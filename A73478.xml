            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>¶ TO THE RIGHT HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable, and my very good Lord, <hi>Iohn Lord Saint Iohn, Baron of Blet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoe, Grace and Peace with great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe</hi> of honour.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I call to minde (right ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable) the buildinge of the Lordes Temple by the Iewes of elder dayes, and there-withall take a vew of the truth of that materiall temple, of the Church I meane, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, and more particularly here in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, this angle of the world: me thinks I may full wel compare theſe two buildings together, whether wee reſpect the cauſes inforcinge, or the hinderances lettinge, or the puniſhments by the Lorde inflicted, for not going forwarde in his woorke. For the cauſes which ought to haue bene as prickes, goades, &amp; ſpurs to the Iewes, were theſe principally. Firſt, the choiſe which the Lord had made of them. For ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Lord had choſen them out of all nations, countries, tongues, and people: for of
<pb facs="tcp:173499:7"/> all the trees of the wood God choſe one onely Vyne: of all the fowles of the ayre, one onely Doue: of all the nations of the world, one one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Iudea: of all the cities of the world Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem alone, that he might build his Temple on high, and put his name there: and ſeeing that being iealouſe of his glory, &amp; carefull for his worſhip, which the Heathen coulde not giue him, for they had not called vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his name, but Hieruſalem was the place of his rest, &amp; there would hee be called vpon, and for this cauſe would hee haue the Temple built at the firſt: it ſtoode them vpon if they woulde eſcape the crime of impietie, and ingratitude, to build the Lordes houſe. Another, the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of their deliuerance out of their late captiuitie, where for ſolace they had ſorrowe, and <hi>pro ſocco ſaccum:</hi> where in ſteed of their owne vynes which they ſome-times had, and vnder which they were wont to ſit, they had Wyllowe-trees, where-on they hanged their harps, as being vnable to ſing the Lords ſong. Seeing that the Lord had deliuered them out of a nation ſo polluted as was this, where they ſaw thoſe Gods worſhipped, which neither they nor their fathers knewe, &amp; had brought them
<pb facs="tcp:173499:7"/> backe againe to their owne countrie that they might worſhip the liuing God according to his law, and that in his holy Temple: what mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes mooued them to delay the building of the Lordes houſe? If the conſideration of thoſe things could not haue ſerued to enforce them, yet the other ought to haue drawen them, as, that <hi>Cyrus</hi> the king of <hi>Perſia</hi> had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded them, and that the Lord of heauen had giuen them this in charge, and had for this cauſe ſhortned their captiuitie. But they were let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and that firſt outwardly, and ſecondly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly. Outwardly by the enimies of <hi>Iuda,</hi> and <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> who when the Lyons force coulde not preuaile, aſſayed by foxes crafte to hinder the Lords building. Inwardly they were lets to them-ſelues, becauſe they ſought their owne thinges, and not the thinges of the Lord, they preferred their owne affaires be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lordes, their owne buildings before the Lords houſe, and their feete were ſwift to build their owne ſieled houſes, where in they them-ſelues might dwell, but they went with leaden heeles about the place of the Lords reſt, which lay in ruinous maner. But as they had ſinned, ſo were they puniſhed: and that euen
<pb facs="tcp:173499:8"/> in thoſe thinges which they preferred before the Lords affaires. For the Lord with-drewe his bleſsing, &amp; it pleaſed him to inflict a curſe vpon them, which <hi>Haggai</hi> doth in ample ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſet downe, namely that they did ſowe much, &amp; gathered in but a litle: they did eate, but they were not ſatiſfied: they did drink, but their thirſt was not quenched: they were cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed, but they felt no warmth: &amp; thoſe which hyred them-ſelues out for wages, receiued wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges as in a bottomeleſſe bagge, which did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit them nothing. Theſe were their plagues and many moe, which to explicate I need not, for why? they ſufficiently expound themſelues. But nowe let vs looke into our owne ſtate. Though the Lorde hath not choſen vs alone out all nations, to call vpon his name, yet hath it pleaſed him to call vs out of darknes into light, to bring vs from horrible ſuperſtition, and Gentiliſme, which raigned ſome times in this our nation, and to giue vs his woorde to be a light to our paths, and a lanterne to our feete in this dark and miſty world, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are we bound to build a Church vnto the Lord as were the Iewes, to build a temple: that in the ſame the Lord may bee worſhipped, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:173499:8"/> the wall of ſeperation is taken away, and the houre is come, that neither in the mounte, neither at Hieruſalem the Lord is worſhipped, but the true worſhippers doe worſhip him in ſpirit and truth. Againe, though our cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuity from Babyloin of the Aſſyrians hath not bene turned as the riuers in the ſouth: yet hath the Lorde brought vs in ſome meaſure from the captiuity of that romiſh Babylon, out of which we ought ſo to depart, that we ought to touche none of her vncleane thinges: and that to the ende wee may worſhip him ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and with an holie worſhip: and therefore ought we to build the Lords Temple. Againe, though <hi>Cyrus</hi> the king of Perſia hath not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned vs this thinge: yet <hi>Cyrus</hi> the Lordes ſheepheard (as the prophet tearmeth him) hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded vs, and why doe we not then erect the ruinous walls of Hieruſalem? But (alas for woe) too many are our lettes. For outwardely wee are letted by the enimies of Iuda and Hieruſalem, the papiſts I meane, who though they can not by violence hinder our labour, becauſe the Lord hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſed in his Vine with a braſen wall, whoſe hedge is not yet broken downe: yet by ſecret meanes they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derminde
<pb facs="tcp:173499:9"/> our worke, &amp; becauſe they wil beare a ſhowe of building, they build with vntempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red morter, or rather vnder colour of buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a Temple to the Lord, they ſet vp a Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue to Satan: yea, by ſattle meanes they ſteale away thoſe ſtones which we ſhoulde lay in the Lords buildinge, that they may bee corner ſtones in their ruinous worke. Theſe are no ſmall lets, but (the more the pitty) we haue as great amonge our ſelues. And the firſt of theſe ſeemeth to bee the ſilence of thoſe which haue ſome-times laboured painefullie, whoſe worke is in daunger to decay, if ſtorme and tempeſt ſhoulde ariſe. An-other let there is, and that is, the labourers want their wages, by reaſon of the vnſatiable couetouſnes of the men of our daies, which will not ſuffer them to let goe the ſpoiles of the Church, impropriations I meane. Againe, amongſt the builders there bee thoſe which fill the roumes of builders, but knowe not how to lay one ſtone vpon an-other, I ſpeake of vnlearned miniſters, if it bee lawfull for mee to call them miniſters, whom I may more rightlie tearme Idoll ſheepheards, or if you wil Siphers in <hi>Augrim.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And manie there be alſo which know howe
<pb facs="tcp:173499:9"/> to build, but they will not, the worlde hath ſo ouer-taken them, and their laſines is ſuch: which both are no ſmall lets to the woorke. And to bee briefe, there is generallie amongſt all a greater care to ſeeke their owne, then the things which are Gods: to preferre their owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie before the Lords glory, &amp; finally, to ſeeke their owne eaſe rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the kingdome of God: &amp; therefore is it that the Lords Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is not builded, and therefore is it that the Lordes plagues are in ſome meaſure vpon vs inflicted. For let vs call to minde theſe latter yeeres, and ſee if the Lord hath not ſcourged vs, as he did ſome-times the Iewes. And to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their puniſhments into this abridgment, that the Lord did not bleſſe the works of their hands, how-ſoeuer they toyled and tooke great paines: haue not we taſted of the like iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t? Let that generall dearth which laye, and as yet doth lie vpon the whole Land, witneſſe: for I will not ſtand to amplifie euery particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar point, for I haſten toward an ende. If the puniſhments of the old people, when wee onely heard thereof, could not mooue vs to build the Temple of the Lord: yet let them now enforce vs, ſeeing wee taſte thereof in ſome meaſure.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:173499:10"/>
            <p>But now to come to your honour. That eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all duetie which to your Lordſhip for many &amp; good cauſes Iowe, hath cauſed mee to publiſhe theſe my labours vnder your honourable title, and that not onely that it may bee a buſh to ſhrowde them from euill tongues, but that as they bee to your good Lordſhip preſented, ſo you may there-by bee mooued, enforced, incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to further the Lords building, and to ſeeke the remoouing of theſe lets and hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances which may ſtay the ſame. And becauſe (right honorable) it is no ſmall help to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon building, for euerie one of what conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo-euer he bee, priuately to erect in his owne family a Church vnto the Lorde, as did that good <hi>Cornelius:</hi> let mee with ſuch reuerence and dutifulnes as I ought, craue at your hands that you would proceede to conſecrate your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors family to the Lorde in ſuch ſorte, that it may with-in your priuate walls reſemble the Lords Church. And how-ſoeuer worldly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects may keepe you backe from this: yet let that feare of the Lord which I know to be pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in you, and my very good Lady your wyfe, ouer-come all theſe lets and hinderancances. It is true liberty (my Lord) not to ſerue ſinne, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:173499:10"/> it is true honor, to honour, and ſerue the Lord aright. This therefore doe, and no doubt the Lord will aduance you, for hee hath promiſed to aduance thoſe to honor, which honor him. Shake of therefore all thoſe things which may hinder you in this courſe of godlines: remooue all hinderances which may keepe you back: call away your eyes from be-holding the vanities of this worlde, whoſe ſhape must paſſe away: make ſtreight ſteps vnto the feare of the Lord: conſecrate your ſelfe to ſerue him: halt not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene the feare of the Lord, and worldly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: purge your houſe from all prophane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſuch as was <hi>Eſau:</hi> ſo ſhall the Lords bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing bee vpon you, ſo ſhall hee to honor aduance you, and ſo ſhall you through faith in Christ, raigne with Chriſt for euer, and euer. The Lord bleſſe your good honor, and encreaſe in you the manifold bleſsings of his ſacred ſpirit. <hi>From my chamber in Southwarke this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent xxj. of Iuly. 1586.</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:173499:13"/> alſo concerning the medicines, and remedies whereby the ſame may be cured: ſeeing that I ſet all thinges before the eyes of the godly to be examined according to the worde of God: and would haue all thinges tried and examined, but thoſe good thinges onelie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, which are correſpondent and agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto the ſtraight rule of the holie ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>In this we are greatly deceiued, that being too too much addicted vnto this world, we do inuent, &amp; greedelie deſire to haue a diuorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made betweene the goſpell of Chriſte crucified, and trouble, and perſecution: and alſo in that wee thinke that wee are able with a weake faith to ouercome this worlde, and thoſe thinges which are therein. We confeſſe that we muſt onelie glorie in the liuing, and almightie God: but in the meane while wee looke to haue the fauour, conſent, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage of princes and noble men. If wee wante theſe, then thinke wee that the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſte is quite vndone. Wee doe throughly weigh &amp; conſider in our mindes, what thinges the world doth denie vnto vs, and what it doth promiſe: but in the meane ſeaſon we doe not marke (vntill ſuch time as wee bee often-times admoniſhed by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of God, and his inſtrumentes) what the Lorde our God doth: howe that by our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries he bringeth good things to paſſe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfullie: howe that by the meanes of our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimies
<pb facs="tcp:173499:13"/> he doth good vnto vs: to howe good and wholeſome an intent he taketh from vs earthlie things, that hee may put heauenlie, and eternall thinges in place thereof.</p>
            <p>Seeing that I doe ſeeme to my ſelfe, not fully to vnderſtand what other men do think of the fountayne, and originall of theſe er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and imaginations: I will boldlie &amp; by the good leaue of others profeſſe that, which I haue alwayes (conferring our affaires with the rule preſcribed by God) thought to be moſt like to be the fountaine thereof.</p>
            <p>The principall cauſe of all thoſe miſeries and ſorrowes, wherewith wee are vexed by the iuſt iudgement of God moſt iuſt, &amp; moſt good; is the weakenes of our faith, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs to be vnable to ouercome this world, and the thinges therein contayned; namelie the riches, glory, and moſt of all the vaine pompe thereof. But notwithſtanding, as the weakenes of faith maketh vs to ſtande in neede of comfort: ſo the ſtedfaſtnes thereof maketh vs to abounde with true and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folde conſolation.</p>
            <p>We doe not ſufficiently ponder that, which notwithſtandinge wee haue alwayes in our mouth, namely, that in God wee liue, wee be, and mooue: that wee are the worke of God: that God hath a care ouer vs: that the liuing and almighty God, is hee, which hath not onelie a great reſpect to all mankinde, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to the church and all the faithfull.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:173499:14"/>
            <p>Therefore wee are afraide to offend Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, wee are ſo afraide of the affliction and death of godlie princes, of the mutable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of men; as if all iudgement, and power were in their handes, and not in the handes of God.</p>
            <p>And although wee heare that Chriſte doth<note place="margin">Pſalm. 10. 2.</note> raygne in the middeſt of his enemies: yet becauſe all his workes are brought to paſſe amiddeſt contrarie meanes; wee doe hardlie ſuffer our ſelues to bee perſwaded, that the truth and thoſe which beare recorde of the ſame, ſhall haue the vpper hande when it is reſiſted, although the enimies thereof doe rage againſt it, and goe about to ouerthrowe the ſame: that the kingdome of Chriſte ſhall come and ſhall floriſh: that the enimies of Chriſte ſhalbe ſo quite taken away, that ſome of them by their ſodayne deſtruction, ſome of them by that deſtruction which commeth vppon them in tract of time, ſhal teſtifie, that God is the iudge of the whole earth.</p>
            <p>Wee heare alſo that the holie ſpirite is the beſt comforter: that the minde and purpoſe of the Lord is knowen vnto him: that he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is the meeteſt witnes to teſtifie vnto vs the mercifull good will of God towarde vs. But in the meane while we haue great reſpect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men, and their counſels and promiſes: as if we coulde be more ſafe vnder their protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then vnder the protection of that ſpirite which gouerneth all thinges.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:173499:14"/>
            <p>What man is hee which doth ſo often and ſo greatlie reioyce that hee is made a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the church, a fellowe Citizen with the ſaintes, one of Gods houſholde, as he ought, and as the thankefulnes of a Chriſtian doth require? I will not now ſpeake of thoſe which are rotten members of the church. Howe many of vs are there which do make ſo great accompt of our calling, regeneration, and iuſtification as wee ought: ſo that wee haue alwayes neede to haue ſome godlie exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion giuen vs, by the godlie teachers, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in wee may be exhorted hereunto.</p>
            <p>Wee quake and tremble, when wee heare any mention made of death, when as in the meane whyle we glorie that wee doe belieue the reſurrection of the fleſhe, and euerlaſting life. To be briefe, we can not away with this to bee baptiſed with the baptiſme of Chriſte his afflictions, and to drinke of the cuppe of his ſuffringes: but wee can bee verie well content with this, to ſit on high in glorie on Chriſtes righte hande, and on his left, in his kingdome: and in that time which the Lord hath appointed for warrefare and afflictions, to triumph, and to leade a moſt happie life.</p>
            <p>Hereunto is added another, and that the greateſt error, that in the choyſe of good &amp; euill, being greatly deceyued, wee thinke that the witneſſes of the truth are vnhappie, ſeeing that they are hated of the worlde; and that thoſe which lay waſte the church, and
<pb facs="tcp:173499:15"/> are the aduerſaries of the truth are happie, becauſe they lye ſofte and fare daint<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Truely, ſeeing that it is meete that the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie doe with great faithfulnes, and diligence endeuour them-ſelues to mitigate the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes of the mindes of men wherewith they are afflicted, as they would extinguiſh a great fire: I will vſe the ſame order in declaring the meanes whereby I endeuor to mitigate the ſame ſorrowe (which I haue ſuffered theſe fewe yeares for the afflictions of the church both publike and priuate: then the which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo I am perſuaded that the paine which I ſhal ſuffer at the departure of my ſoule out of the priſon of this my body, ſhalbe nothing grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) which I ſee obſerued in the canon of our faith, I meane the Apoſtles creede.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:173499:24"/> Therefore wee ſee that men which did excell in witte, learning, eloquence, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in great matters, haue bene driuen away by certaine Drone-bees, and haue bene diſperſed as the Bees are ſcattered abroade with ſmoake. But as in times paſt, the diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing abroade of the faithfull, after the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome of Stephen, did greatlie profit the Samaritanes, and others next adioyning vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, when as manie being conuerted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, did caſt awaie the heatheniſh Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, and Idolatrie vſed of the Samaritanes, &amp; did ioyne them-ſelues vnto the true church: ſo I hope in the Lord Ieſus, that it ſhall come to paſſe, that thexile of theſe holie men, both younge and olde, ſhall greatlie ſerue to the ſpreading abroade of the truth, the glorie of God, and the reſtoring of the church.</p>
            <p>Whenas in times paſt the Samaritanes were grieued at the reſtoring of Hieruſalem, and left nothinge vnaſſayed, which might make to the hinderance thereof: by the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueilous prouidence of God, their intent fell out to the contrarie: ſo that they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced againſt their will to further the ſame, and alſo to beare the charges thereof, at the commaundement of <hi>Darius</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſpes.</hi> And who is he that doth not ſee, that euen at this time, the mindes of the godlie learned are more &amp; more inflamed with the loue of the truth, and with zeale to defend the ſame, through that outragious obſtinacie
<pb facs="tcp:173499:25"/> and vehemencie of their aduerſaries, moſt horribly defending their aſſertions; ſo that the truth is farther broughte to the light thereby?</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> The ſixtenth place (that I maie of ſet pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe paſſe ouer manie other moſt comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble places) <hi>is the hope of the victorie, and the ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ende.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Truelie it is as certaine and ſure, that (their Sophiſtrie, and vaine-babling being refuted) the truth ſhall haue the victorie: as it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that this world was created by <hi>GOD,</hi> and is by him preſerued. And hereupon it is that the banner of the truth is often-times diſplaied, to the great terror, and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theſe Sophiſters; but to the ioy of the godlie, which is thereby increaſed. Wee haue ſeene wyth our eyes theſe Sophiſters pleading their euill cauſe with ſuch feare, and trembling; that by the palenes of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce, the trembling of their members, their confuſed oration, they them-ſelues did bewraie their ſubtiltie, and hidden wounde of conſcience. Howe often hath this fallen out amongſt them, that they which ſuppoſe them-ſelues to be able to preſcribe lawes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to other men, were not able to anſwere the ſpirit, and wiſedome of <hi>GOD,</hi> which ſpake in the mouth of godlie yonge men. The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> I confeſſe was full of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitie and affliction: yet was the ſame moſt fruitfull to the church, and to him moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
<pb facs="tcp:173499:25"/> euen in the midſt of his miſeries. And ſeeing that the miniſterie of our paſtors and teachers is ſuch: let vs in no caſe thinke that their labour ſhall be in vaine in the Lord. For they which do ſowe the doctrine of the truth with manie teares, ſhall in their time reape with ioy.<note place="margin">Pſalm. 126. 5.</note>

                  <p n="15">15 Therefore Haggai beganne to ſay thus, So is this people, and ſo is this nation before

               <hi>Hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geus,</hi> wee haue touched thoſe<note place="margin">1. Lect. 19. Oct. 1579</note> things which were to bee ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of his booke in ſtéede of a preface: it ſéemeth good to mée in this firſt lecture, firſt of all to ſpeake in generall of the Prophets, that we may know what we ought to thinke general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerning them, and what accompt wée ought to make of them. Secondly, if time per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, I will ſpeake by name of <hi>Haggeus,</hi> and of his authoritie. Laſtly, I wil briefly note to you the cauſes for which I tooke in hande the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the ſame Prophet.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A methode concerning the Prophets, according to certaine places of inuention.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 The ſelfe ſame men were called in times<note place="margin">Notation.</note> paſt both Seers and Prophets. <hi>In times paſt in Iſrael euery one ſaid on this wiſe, when he went to aſke an anſwere of God, Come let vs goe vnto the Seer: becauſe he which is called a Prophet at this day, was in times paſt called a Seer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They were called Seers in reſpect of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe,
<pb n="1" facs="tcp:173499:32" rendition="simple:additions"/> and alſo of the effect. I call the viſion ſhewed vnto them by the Lorde, the cauſe, which did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the Prophets in great matters. <hi>The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens</hi>
               <note place="margin">Paul calleth it Reuelation by the general name.</note> 
               <hi>were opened, and I ſawe the viſions of God*. But Daniel vnderſtoode all the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the dreames.</hi> I call the light of the minde, and the excellent knowledge of the ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles<note place="margin">Ezech. 1. 1. Dan. 1. 17.</note> of God, the <hi>Effect,</hi> wherein the Prophets did excell all other men.</p>
            <p>And it ſeemeth they were called Prophets for this cauſe, becauſe they were interpreters of the will of God, according to the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, which <hi>Paul</hi> calleth <hi>Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on*.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Aaron thy brother ſhall be thy Prophet,</hi> that is, thine interpreter*. Wee reade that<note place="margin">Exo. 7. 1.</note> ſome men haue attained vnto this gift by vſe, as <hi>Ieſaias:</hi> and that other ſome receyued the ſame at the handes of God: foraſmuch as they were called vnto the office of propheſying farre con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie<note place="margin">Ier. 1. 6. 7.</note> to their expectation, as <hi>Ieremie*,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos*.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Amos. 7. 14. 15.</note>
            </p>
            <p>This words <hi>Prophet</hi> is not affirmed of diuers ſortes of men in one and the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, in the holy Scriptures. For it is attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<note place="margin">The diuers ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications of this word Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet. Tit. 1. 12.</note> vnto the heatheniſh Poetes improperly. <hi>A certaine man of them, being their own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, ſaid, the Cretians are alwayes lyers, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill beaſtes, ſlowe bellies*.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 Secondly this worde <hi>Prophet</hi> is affirmed<note place="margin">Which is whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:173499:33"/> ſtronge drinke, they are ſwallowed vppe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of wine, they haue gone aſtray through drinke, they haue erred in the viſion, they haue ſtumbled in iudgement.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Thirdly this worde (<hi>Prophete</hi>) is taken by tranſſumption, ſomtimes for the doctrine of the Prophets, ſomtimes for their bookes. <hi>Think not that I am come to deſtroye the lawe or</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 17.</note> 
               <hi>the Prophets *,</hi> that is, their doctrine. <hi>It is written in the Prophets: And they ſhall bee</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn. 6. 45</note> 
               <hi>all taught of God *.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4 Fourthly, it is taken properly, as in theſe ſayinges: <hi>Wee ſee not our ſignes, neither is their a prophet any more, neither is there with vs any that vnderſtandeth any more *.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 74. 9.</note> And againe, <hi>I haue made thee the prophet of</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ier. 1. 5.</note> 
               <hi>the Gentiles *.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5 Fiftly according to the moſt principall ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification<note place="margin">Iohn. 1. 4. Deut. 18.</note> 
               <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſaide to bee that Prophet, which ſhould come. I thought good to note thus much concerning the diuers ſignifications of the worde.</p>
            <p>Euerie Prophete is the ſeruaunt of God,<note place="margin">3. Genus.</note> but not on the contrary. <hi>Synce the day that your fathers went out of the lande of Egypt, vntill this daye, haue I ſent vnto you all my ſeruauntes the Prophets, riſing day by daye, early in the morning, and ſending them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob. Your ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes &amp; your daughters ſhal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioel. 2. 28.</note> *. Therefore all the ſeruauntes of God are Prophets.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> I anſwere that there is a fallacie, which is
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:173499:33"/> called * <hi>Fallacia Aequiuocationis,</hi> in this word<note place="margin">Which is when a worde hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> 
               <hi>Propheſie,</hi> becauſe in the ſaying of <hi>Ioel</hi> it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken generally for the general confeſſion of thoſe which doe with the heart beléeue vnto righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. But we doe nowe ſpeake of the degrée of that good order and diſcipline which God hath appointed in his Church, namely of the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall office in ſpeciall.</p>
            <p>All the Prophets were not of one ſorte. It ſeemeth there were fower ſortes of Prophets,<note place="margin">4. kindes.</note> whereof the laſt is as yet vſed, ſeeing that the Church militant cannot be without the ſame.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The firſt was of thoſe, which when they did execute ſome ordinarie function in the church, were raiſed vp extraordinarilie by God to purge the celeſtiall doctrine.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The ſeconde was of thoſe who did both fore-tell things to come, and alſo did peculiarlie applie the Scriptures vnto certaine particuler cauſes, places, and times: being enforced there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto by the holie ſpirite.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The third was of thoſe to whom it was geuen to expounde the ſcriptures, yet being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with a certaine power, and peculiar gift of vnder-ſtanding, whereby <hi>Paul</hi> doth diſtinguiſh them from the Doctors.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The fourth is of thoſe who being law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie called of the Church, doe expounde the Scriptures according to the proportion of faith, and they are called Doctors.</p>
            <p>Theſe foure orders are dyſtinguiſhed one from another, according to the forme of doctrin,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:173499:34"/> and calling. Furthermore, the Prophets of the olde-teſtament, are called olde, <hi>* Luke 9.</hi> and the <hi>Former, Za. 7.</hi> to diſtinguiſh them from the Prophets of the newe Teſtament.</p>
            <p>None is a Prophet ſaue hee whom God hath<note place="margin">V. Difference.</note> called, that beinge inſpired with the ſpirit of Chriſt, hee may either fore-tell certaine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> things to come: or truely interprete the oracles of God. Therefore it is laide to the charge of the falſe Prophets, as a great fault, that they being not called did teach. <hi>I haue not ſent thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hie. 23. 21.</note> 
               <hi>and yet they did runne: I haue not ſpoken vnto them, and they did propheſie. And if they had ſtande in my ſecret place, &amp; had made this people to heare my wordes. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is proper to the true Prophets to ſpeake<note place="margin">VI. Properties.</note> in the ſpirit, concerning thoſe thinges which God hath ſhewed them. <hi>If there ſhalbe a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi>
               <note place="margin">Num. 12. 6.</note> among you, I the Lord will appeare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him in a viſion, in a dreame will I ſpeake with him *.</p>
            <p>Dauid by the ſpirit calleth him Lorde. * Propheſying was not brought in times paſt by the will of man, but the holie men of God being mooued with the holie ghoſte, did ſpeake.</p>
            <p>The Prophets were witneſſes of Chriſte *.<note place="margin">VII. Adiunct.</note> 
               <hi>And vnto this man do all the Prophets beare witnes, that euerie one which ſhall beleeue in him, ſhall receiue remiſſion of ſinnes, through</hi>

            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:173499:34"/>
            <p>There were alſo certaine of the Prophets of the olde Teſtament, which did gouerne certaine ciuill counſells, as wee maie ſee in the hiſtories of <hi>Hieremie,</hi> and of the Prophet <hi>Daniell.</hi>

                     <hi>Haggeus</hi> hauing confuted the reaſon which the Iewes broughte in defence of their negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence: doth teach that it did neither ſtand with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, neither yet with piety, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> they did ſo longe deferre the reſtoring of the temple.</p>
                  <p>This was the argument which the Iewes did vſe. There is a time to plucke downe, and there is a time to builde vp. <hi>Eccle. 3. 3.</hi> But the time is not yet come, that the houſe of the Lord ſhould bee builded: therefore are not wee to be reprooued for our ſlacknes in building the houſe of the Lord.</p>

                     <p>Some men do verie godlily deuide the will of God, into that which is hidden from vs, and that which is reuealed vnto vs, and whereof the annoynting of the holie ſpirit doth teſtifie.</p>

               <p>Therefore the firſt part of this oration is iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall: the latter conſiſteth vpon an exhortation and a giuing of counſell.</p>
               <p>The iuredicial ſtate beareth the chiefe ſway in the firſt parte. The reſtoring of the Temple hath hitherto ben omitted vngodlily and vniuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. This propoſition doeth our Prophet proue by two arguments.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The firſt argument is fet a <hi>comparatis,</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> comparing of thinges together.

But you Iewes doe the ſame, as your ſieled houſes, and the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Lorde which lyeth waſt doe ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently teſtifie.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The ſeconde argument is fet from the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte. Certaine it is that the tranſgreſſors of the lawe are accurſed, according to the ſaying. <hi>Curſed is hee which continueth not in all</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The ſtate of the latter part of the oration wherein is contained a giuing of counſell, is in like ſorte iurediciall. You ſhall doe well, and it ſhall turne to your great commoditie, if

                  <p>As Phiſitions which haue taken in hande to cure any pacient, beginning with a recital of the cauſe of the diſeaſe, do firſt intreat of the diſeaſe: then comming to ſpeake of the remedies for the diſeaſe, they preſcribe Phiſicke for the ſame: ſo ſinners are firſt to bee inſtructed concerning the greatneſſe of ſinne, then are they alſo to bee taught concerning the forgiuenes of ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>We haue an hiſtoricall example of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, in this ſermon of <hi>Haggeus</hi> which he made vnto the people of the <hi>Iewes:</hi> and there is a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue example therof extant in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romanes.</hi> For (that I may ſpeake onely of this latter example) the Apoſtle doeth firſt of all bring to light thoſe diſeaſes wherewith man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde is infected, namely originall ſinne, and his fruites, which the ſame <hi>Paul</hi> doth call in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other place, <hi>The workes of the fleſhe:</hi> ſecondly

                  <p>That is the beſt kinde of teaching that can be vſed in the Church, which together with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of falſe doctrine, and the reprehenſion of ſinnes, doeth ioyne the doctrine of faith, hope and charitie, &amp; addeth moreouer godly exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the doing of the duetie.

                  </argument>
                  <p>The handling of this verſe according to the art of Logike.</p>
                  <p>This verſe contayneth firſt a fallacie fray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Iewes, which our prophet refuteth: ſecondly a demonſtration which <hi>Haggeus</hi> vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth ſtraitly againſt them.</p>
                  <p>The Iewes did argue thus. What thing ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer is done out of time is not well done. But that time which the Lorde hath appointed for the reſtoring of his holy temple is not yet come. Wherefore we are not to be blamed for neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the reſtoring of the temple.</p>
                  <p>This was a very fine reaſon for theſe men which did ſéeke their owne things, and not the things which are Gods.</p>
                  <p>They might paint their maior propoſition with theſe moſt excellent ſayinges touching op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie and time, which are to be founde both in the holy Scriptures, and alſo in prophane writers.</p>
                  <p>There is an appointed time for euery thing, and there is a time for euery will vnder hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. &amp;c. Eccl. 3. 1. Who is a faithfull and wiſe Steward, whom the Lord may appoint ouer his familie, to giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their portion of meat in due ſeaſon. Luk. 12. 42. Redeeming the time becauſe the dayes are euill. Eph. 5. 16.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:173499:54"/> The principall thing to bee reſpected in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery thing is that it bee done in due time. * Pyndarus in Pyth.</p>
                  <p>And agayne. <hi>It is an excellent thing to obſerue opportunitie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And agayne. <hi>As great thinges ſo ſmall thinges are giuen in time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Furthermore they thought they could proue the minor propoſition, wherein the controuerſie conſiſteth, by this reaſon. The reſtoring of the Temple hath hitherto bene letted, partly by the malice of the <hi>Samaritanes,</hi> and cumbates had with them: partly by the kinges commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: partly by the neceſſarie buſineſſe in the ſetting in order of houſholde and ciuil affaires. Which thinges ſhoulde in no caſe haue happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, if God woulde haue had vs to haue left all other thinges vndone, and onely to occupie our ſelues about the reſtoring of the Temple. Hee might haue taken away all theſe lettes and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derances, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But as it is in the <hi>Pſal. 94. 11. The Lorde knoweth the thoughtes of men that they are vanitie *.</hi> Therefore (that I may vſe artificiall words) he aunſwereth both the man and alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter. The man or perſon hee aunſwereth by a reduplication, and alſo by a reprehenſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whether or no, (o yee) is it time for you?</hi> As if he ſhoulde haue ſaide, Are ye not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med hauing receiued ſo many benefites at the hande of the Lorde, and beeing newly brought out of captiuitie and reſtored into your owne
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:173499:54"/> countrie: to preferre your owne commoditie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the glorie of God? Againe hee calleth them vnto an other thing.</p>
                  <p>For he calleth them from their owne buſines, vnto a more weightie matter, which was the temple of the Lorde, whereunto without doubt they ought to haue had greater regard, then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their owne priuate houſes.</p>
                  <p>In anſwering the matter by the denying of their minor propoſition, and the declaring of the place <hi>a Connexis,</hi> from the thinges knit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: he ſheweth that euen in the middeſt of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, and in the perilous times, wee ought to haue reſpect vnto the glorie of God. For as the Church militant doeth triumph vnder the croſſe: ſo doeth ſhe alſo giue vnto God the honour due vnto him, with great reuerence, euen when ſhee is oppreſſed, and afflicted, many wayes.</p>
                  <p>For ſhe is fully perſwaded of that which <hi>Paul</hi> taught in theſe wordes, <hi>If we haue hope onely in Chriſt, in this worlde, we are of all men the moſt miſerable *.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 19.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>And agayne. <hi>We ſuffer perſecution, but wee are not forſaken therein: wee are caſt downe but wee doe not periſh, euery where we beare about in our bodie the dying of the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, that the life of Ieſus may be made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in our bodies *.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>They are much deceiued which thinke, that the Temple of the Lorde ought onely to be builded then: when all things are quiete, and in time of proſperitie: that is, which thinke that
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:173499:55"/> wee can be builded vpon the foundation of the Prophetes and Apoſtles, and that wee can bee brought vnto the kingdome of the euerlaſting father, by theſe middle honours, ioyes, and good ſucceſſes, which we haue in this life. For as the heathen man ſaith, <hi>In rebus arduis prodit ſe virtus,</hi> Vertue ſheweth her ſelfe in harde mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. So that the Church whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it groneth vnder the croſſe, addeth vnto faith vertue, vnto vertue<note place="margin">2. Pet. 1. 5. 6.</note> knowledge, vnto knowledge temperance, vnto temperance patience * &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now let vs ſee how ſtrong that demonſtration is, which our prophet <hi>Haggai</hi> ſetteth againſt y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> fallacy and ſubtile reaſon which was framed by the Iewes.</p>
                  <p>There is greater regard to bee had vnto him, who is moſt good, moſt wiſe, moſt iuſt, &amp;c. and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> author of al goodnes throughout y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole world: then vnto all creatures. This propoſition is a principle, which is written by God in the harts of all men, which teacheth vs to attribute more vnto our moſt liberal creator, then to al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> things which are created, and alſo to obey &amp; ſerue him,<note place="margin">Mat. 19. 17. Iam. 1. 17.</note> readely, ſincerely, and conſtantly. But the Lord our God is moſt good, moſt wiſe, &amp; moſt iuſt, and from him alone commeth euery good, &amp; perfecte gift. Therfore ſéeing he will haue a temple built for himſelfe, and the worſhip which is due vnto him, to be giuen him there: we are to let paſſe al other buſines and letts, and onely to apply the building thereof day and night.</p>

                  <p>The application of this ſaying of Haggeus vnto ourſelues.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>Nowe that we may goe from the argument vnto the poſition, we muſt fully determine with our ſelues, that nothing which is created muſt be able to ſeparate vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the loue of God, which is in Chriſte Ieſus our Lorde *. And that we<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 36.</note> ought to preferre nothing which is in heauen or earth before God. And that the feare of the Lord is our treaſure. *.</p>
               <p>The fountaine from which this poſition ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth<note place="margin">Iſay. 33. 6.</note> is the lawe of God. <hi>Thou ſhalt loue the Lorde thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoule, and with all thy ſtrength. Deut. 6. 5. Luk. 10. 27.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the ſame is moſt notably expounded in <hi>Ieremie. Cap. 9. 23. 24. Thus ſaith the Lord, Let not the wiſe man reioyce in his wiſedom, nor the ſtronge man in his ſtrength, nor the rich man in his riches: but let him that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyceth reioyce in this that hee vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and knoweth that I am the Lord, which ſhewe mercie, iudgement, and iuſtice in the earth: for theſe thinges will I, ſayth the Lorde.</hi>

               <p>Séeing theſe things are ſo, who ſeeth not that all thinges muſt ſerue God, &amp; to the worſhiping of him: and that we ought not to make ſo great accompt of any thing as of God, and of his holy and holeſome will.</p>
               <p>Nowe foraſmuch as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, and that truely, that doctrine is attayned vnto by <hi>Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme</hi> and <hi>Induction,</hi> wée will vſe theſe two inſtruments, to prooue this poſition withall.</p>

But this is an eternall and immutable order appointed by God, that mans affaires, &amp; all other thinges ſhould giue place to the things which are his. For it is moſt méete that all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinges ſhould giue place to that, which is the infinite good thinge. Therefore we muſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute much more vnto the thinges which are Gods, then to all thinges which are in this worlde.</p>

For there is no propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or equality betwene that which is finite, &amp; that which is infinite. But man is the creature
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:173499:57"/> of God, compaſſed about with beginning, and ſpace, both of time and place. <hi>Pſalm. 100. 3. Knowe yee that the Lord hee is God: hee hath made vs, and not wee our ſelues.</hi> And, GOD is a ſpirit, vncreated, eternall, with-out beginninge, almighty, &amp;c. Therefore we ought to haue greateſt reſpect vnto him in all our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, and actions.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 It is better to obey that will which is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaungeably good, and whoſe effects are good: then the will which is chaungeable, and whoſe effects are vnlike one to another.

                  <p>Wee will handle thrée thinges in this place: firſt, the phraſe or manner of ſpeech, and the wordes: ſecondly, the argument: and thirdly, the doctrine.</p>
                  <p>This manner of ſpeech, <hi>To ſet the heart vpon anie thinge,</hi> is ſo to conſider vppon any thinge, that thou mayeſt vnderſtand the ſame throughly, the miniſtrie of the ſenſes ſeruinge vnto this inquiſition. <hi>Ezechiel. 40. 4.

                     <hi>Heart.</hi>) The heart of man doth properly ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the Lorde of life in mans body, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth by the Veynes and Synowes, the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of others, and ſendeth into all partes of the body by the Arteries or vitall Veynes, the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Spirit, which is a liuelie flame, not much vnlike the celeſtiall nature, ſéeing that it doth not onely nouriſhe the members with the heate thereof, but alſo helpeth the actions. It put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vs in minde of manie weightie matters, whereof theſe are part.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that as without the heat and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of the heart, mans bodie cannot continue ſounde, and in good temperature, neither can it liue, becauſe the heart is the fountaine of the vitall Spirits: ſo without the holie ghoſt, and his giftes, the Church cannot floriſh.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as the Arteries and Veynes are coupled together, and one entreth into an other, one helpeth an other by nouriſhing, and giuing
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:173499:59"/> life one to an other: ſo ought there to be a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall participation, &amp; imparting of good turnes among men, whether wee reſpect the Church particularlie, or all man-kinde generallie.</p>
                  <p>The commodities ſpringing and flowinge from the heart, are theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Firſt, it giueth life vnto the whole bodie, according to the ſaying of <hi>Ariſtotle:</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Cor eſt principium vitae omni parti, datque viuificum calorem omni, ſpiritumque cerabro &amp; hepati.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The heart is the beginning of life to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie parte, and giueth liuely heate vnto euery parte, and life to the Braine, and Lyuer.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Secondly, it miniſtreth the inſtruments of the principall actions in the Braine, and ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowes. I call the vitall Spirites the next in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments: the Actions, the Cogitations, the Senſes, and Motions.</p>
                  <p>But let theſe thinges paſſe, and let vs brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly note the metaphoricall ſignifications of this worde <hi>Heart.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>The Heart by <hi>Metonymia</hi> doth ſignifie the middle parte of any thinge. <hi>Exod. 15. 8. Pſalm, 46. 2.

                  <p>Wée muſt for the declaration, and laying o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen of this ſentence, adde one ſyllogiſme, and that after the manner of the <hi>Geometricians.</hi> The whole drift of this ſentence is this, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince the Iewes of the breach of the lawe and alſo to reproue them for the ſame. For they woulde neuer haue giuen place to the whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome counſels &amp; perſwaſions of the Prophets, vnleſſe they had béene ſufficiently tolde of the greatneſſe, and dangerouſnes of theſe diſeaſes, and euils, wherewith they were infected.</p>
                  <p>The curſe of God is a puniſhment moſt due<note place="margin">Deut. 27. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>But God hath hitherto curſed you Iewes, and as yet doeth he puniſh you.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it is certayne that you are gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the breach of the law of God.</p>
                  <p>He proueth the <hi>minor</hi> propoſition by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, wherein the younger ſort ſhall note,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Firſt the fountayne or firſt originall of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:173499:66"/> this curſe which the Prophet here denounceth. <hi>Deut. 28. 38. Thou ſhalt bring foorth much ſeede vnto the lande, and ſhalt gather but a little: becauſe the locuſt ſhall conſume it. Thou ſhalt plant vineyards, and ſhalt til, and ſhalt not drinke wine, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 Secondly, the expolition or amplification of this manner of curſe. <hi>Mich. 6. 13. 14. I will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo make thee to bee ſicke, by ſmiting thee, I wil make thee deſolate becauſe of thy ſinnes. Thou ſhalt eate and not bee ſatiſfied: and thee humbling of thee ſhall bee in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of thee, thou ſhalt touch a wife, and ſhee ſhall not bring foorth,</hi> (that is, ſhée ſhall not bring thée foorth Children,) <hi>and thoſe whome ſhee ſhall bring forth wil I giue to the ſword. Thou ſhalt ſow and ſhalt not reape: thou ſhalt treade the olyues, and ſhall not bee annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with oyle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 Thirdly, the manner and forme of this curſe. The Iewes did ſowe plentifully, but they did reape but a little: they did eate, but they were not ſatiſfied: they did drinke, but their thirſt was not quenched: they were cloathed, but they were not warme: they gathered mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, but in a broken bagge. The like iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was executed vpon all their labours, and affaires, both houſhold and ciuil. Therfore euen by this that their labour was in vayne, and not bleſſed, may wee gather, that God had accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them as tranſgreſſours of his law.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Fourthly, the teſtimonies &amp; affectes both
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:173499:67"/> of the curſe, and alſo of the bleſſing of God. A priuate or houſholde bleſſing is this, a plentiful harueſt farre excéeding the quantitie of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and of the ſéede that was ſowen: the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate ſufficiencie of meate and drinke: honeſt and comely apparell: aboundance of neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and houſholde ſtuffe, and other thinges whereof mention is made. <hi>Pſalm. 128. Deut. 28. Leu. 26.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Out of the ſame places may wée gather the diuers kindes of ciuill bleſſings, whereof we wil ſpeake elſe where.</p>
                  <p>And wée muſt define the curſe not onely by the priuation or wanting of good thinges, but alſo by the infinite number of euils.</p>
                  <p>It is not ſufficent for vs to know theſe things contemplatiuely, but wee muſt alſo apply them vnto our owne vſe, that wée may not onely learne to be wyſe by other mens harmes, and to profit by the good thinges of others: but alſo that béeing taught by our owne harmes, wee may bring foorth better fruites: and that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing our heartes cheared with theſe good things which wée haue receyued at the handes of the Lorde, wee may declare and proue our thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe and deſire which wee haue to obey him.

Make me to vnderſtand the way of thy commaundements, and I will meditate vpon thy marueylous woorkes. ver. 29. Remoue from me the way of falſehod, and geue me thy doctrine. 30. I haue choſen the way of thy trueth: I haue ſet thy lawes before me.</hi> And although the Prophet doth in that pſalme ſpeake generally of the ſtudy of all the faithfull: yet is there no cauſe why we may
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:173499:68"/> not apply his ſayinges vnto thoſe which ought to carry the light of the celeſtiall doctrine before their hearers, and who for their offices ſake ought to adorne their doctrine with vprightnes of life.</p>
                  <p>And to the ende we may in this place vſe a certayne methode and order, wee will here diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the additions touching the way of the ſtudy of diuinitie, according to the oppoſition of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries, whereof there is one and the ſame do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and which beeing matched together doe more euidently appeare,</p>
                  <p>The ſtudent of holy ſcripture which ſetteth vpon his heart the way of his ſtudie (that I may vſe the Hebrue phraſe) muſt conſider and throughly marke theſe thinges.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Firſt the traueiler. As a traueiler ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in a place where thrée wayes méete, doeth earneſtlie conſider vppon the right way, vppon a faithfull guide, and vpon many other things: ſo ought the ſtudentes of holy Scripture, often times and earneſtly to thinke vppon the right way to learne, vpon a guyde, and vpon the helps whereof they ſhall ſtande in neede in this their iourney.</p>
                  <p>For it is wicked negligence, and great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, if a man doe not conſider with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, what way hee hath taken in his ſtudie, and bée not moued with deſire to knowe the trueth: and if hée be like thoſe of whom our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaketh, who are alwayes learning, yet can they neuer attayne to the knowledge of the<note place="margin">2. Tim. 3. 7.</note>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:173499:68"/> trueth *.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The way. The way of true doctrine doth diſtinctly comprehende the law and the Goſpell. On the contrary, that is the way of lying which tranſformeth the Goſpell into the lawe, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth thereunto the inuentions of mans brayne.</p>
                  <p>Of the ampleneſſe hereof there is mention made in the 119. Pſalme verſe 96. <hi>In euerie perfection I haue ſeene an ende: but thy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes are exceeding broade.</hi> All o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kindes of learning haue their endes: but Diuinitie reacheth ſo farre, that wee which are in the way of faith doe know onely a part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13. 9.</note> And the lawe is it which maketh our diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes knowen vnto vs, the Goſpell miniſtreth medicine to cure the ſame: yet ſo that the one helpeth the other.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Thirdly the guyde. Chriſte Ieſus is our guyde, the way, the trueth, the life, and our tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher. On the contrary Sathan leadeth our mindes into error, after they are by him bewit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched: let vs therefore heare Chriſte, him let vs followe, neither let vs thruſt into his place <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>

                     <hi>Caluin,</hi> or finally any mortall man howe learned and godly ſoeuer he bee. For not euen the teacher of the Gentiles <hi>Paul,</hi> woulde haue any of the faithfull to bee called after his name. And moſt true is that which <hi>Galene</hi> ſaith, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching theſe which are giuen to ſectes: that, <hi>They</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Cor. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>are blinde and deafe, ſo that they can ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heare nor ſee theſe thinges which other men can eaſily perceyue.</hi>

                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:173499:69"/>4 Fourthlie the end of the iourney. Let him which entreth the ſtudy of wiſedome, begin with God, goe forward with God, and let him man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſtryue to come vnto God who is the chiefe good thing, the chiefeſt wiſedome: forgetting thoſe thinges which hee lefte behinde him.</p>
                  <p>In this our courſe wee are by a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full periode brought backe vnto him at whome wee beganne. But thoſe which haue entred the waye of lying, are turned backe from God vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the creatures, from the chiefeſt good thing, vnto things which are euil, and being caught in Satans nette, they doe at length miſerably pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.</p>

                     <p n="1">1 The firſt is fet <hi>a Facili,</hi> from the facilitie of it. Certaine it is that opportunitie to do things well, is the ſinguler gifte of God, by meanes whereof it commeth to paſſe that thoſe thinges which are moſt difficult, doe become eaſie and readie. But God hath giuen you moſt ſinguler opportunitie to buylde the Temple: which may ſufficiently be prooued by this, that the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances doe excellently agrée nowe vnto this purpoſe: and all theſe lettes and hinderan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which hitherto haue hindered you, are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away. Wherefore yée Iewes goe too, and bée not ſlacke to doe your duetie. <hi>Goe vp into the mountaine, bring thence tymber, buylde the Temple &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Séeing that the Lorde doeth not onely in

                     <p>Let not the vertuous and ſtudious yong men neglect any opportunity, whenas they may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit in learning and manners: but let them laye holde vppon it readely, valiantly, and conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when it is offered vnto them, and let them imploy and apply the ſame vnto their vſe.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. The firſt is <hi>Homonymiae,</hi> or fet from the ambiguitie of the worde. For that which <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of Chriſte in the concrete, ſome men doe falſelie vnderſtande in the abſtract, of the nature which Chriſt tooke.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Whence commeth this efficacie of the worde of God?</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT dependeth vppon the principall efficient cauſe, that is vppon the liuing and almightie God, who ſpeaking vnto the heart of man giueth life and light vnto the ſame, that it may bee both moſt ſwéetely refreſhed, and alſo followe him when hée calleth: leaſt any man ſhoulde falſely ſuppoſe that there is ſome magicall force, either in the worde written or preached.</p>
               <p>The courſe and order of the ſubordinate effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſes is this.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Firſt the principall cauſe is God. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore foraſmuch as theſe externall workes are attributed to all the perſons of the holy tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, the teſtimonies of Scripture doe ſometime attribute that generally to God, that hee doeth write his worde in our heartes. As for example.<note place="margin">Ier. 31. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <hi>I will giue my lawe in the middeſt of them, and I will write it in their heartes.</hi> Sometime they doe attribute it vnto one perſon onely. As
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:173499:83"/> for example. <hi>The ſpirit of trueth ſhall lead you into all truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For hee ſhall not ſpeake of him ſelfe, but whatſoeuer hee heareth, that ſhall</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 16. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>hee ſpeake, and hee ſhall tell you what is to come.</hi> By this place of Scripture wee doe ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the ſpirite of God doeth both teach vs, and alſo that hee teacheth vs, and beateth into vs that doctrine which the Father woulde haue to bee reuealed vnto the Church by his ſonne.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly, the fellowe cauſe is faith, which is kindled by the holy ſpirit after that the heart of man is once lightned by the worde, and that it may ſhinne as a lampe, it is nouriſhed by the ſame ſpirite, by adding thereto matter and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment. <hi>Heb. 4. 2. For vnto vs was the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell preached aſwell as vnto them: but the worde which they heard did profit them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, becauſe it was not mixed with faith, in thoſe that hearde it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 By theſe wordes wee gather, firſt, that the worde is effectuall, being mixed with faith, that is, when the correlatiue, which is faith, doth anſwere vnto his relatiue, which is the word of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly, wee muſt thinke the ſame thing concerning the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, which as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, are the viſible worde of God. Vnleſſe faith bee ioyned with them, wee reape no fruit thereby, but ſuch as turneth to the deſtruction of a man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> Therefore the worde of God, and the Sacramentes doe depende vppon the faith of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:173499:83"/> men, ſo that without this faith there is no veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and efficacie in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwere by an inſtance. Therefore the riſing of the ſunne dependeth vpon the ſight: ſo that vnleſſe lyuing creatures do ſee it cannot ryſe. Howe is it then that ſo manie lyuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which are blinde doe no whit hinder the ryſing of the ſunne?</p>
               <p>Therefore it is a popiſh toye, to feigne that the worde of God and the Sacraments doe giue grace, by the worke wrought, that is, if the worde be hearde onely with the outward eares, and the ſacramentes bee externally receyued: though faith be not ioyned therewithall.</p>
               <p>Furthermore it is a fooliſh kinde of tranſmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for a man to ſeperate the Worde and the Sacramentes, and to chaunge the Sacraments into idols, &amp; to attribute greater efficacie vnto them, then vnto the Worde. For vnleſſe the worde bee added vnto the element, there ſhall be no ſacrament. Moreouer it is euident that the worde is ſufficient, if the ſacrament bee wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: but not on the contrarie. And nowe, if in an vnbeleeuer the word of God be not effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, what force ſhall the ſacramentes haue in him?</p>
               <p>Therefore let vs affirme that which is moſt true, that the efficacie of the worde and ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes doeth depend vpon the will of God. And that hee will haue faith to bee ioyned therewith in the right vſe thereof. And conſequently that God who giueth not holy thinges vnto dogges
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:173499:84"/> will not haue the vnbeleeuers to bee made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the truth of the word and ſacraments, aſwell as the faithfull.</p>
               <p>Therefore as blindnes hath not power to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde the light, nor deafenes to heare the words which are vttered, neither numneſſe of the lymmes to feele the qualities which are percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by touching: but let and hinder men from perceyuing ſuch obiectes: ſo incredulitie which is the priuation of faith, hath no greater force then the worde of God, and the ſacraments, but yet notwithſtanding it doeth ſo let and hinder the Infidels that they cannot bee made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the internall worde and the ſubſtaunce of the ſacrament. For faith is ſuch an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall cauſe that without the ſame we cannot lay holde vpon the celeſtiall giftes. As without eyes no man ſeeth, without eares no man hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, without ſmelling no man ſmelleth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taſting no man diſcerneth taſtes, without touching no man toucheth any thing: ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith can no man ſee, heare, ſmell, taſte, eat, and finally touch Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Thirdly the inſtrumental cauſe is, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the worde of God. 2. <hi>Cor. 3. 9. For wee are Gods miniſters. 1. Cor. 3. 5. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore who is Paul or who is Apollos, but the miniſters by whome yee haue beleeued, and as the Lorde hath giuen to euerie man. Mat. 16. The Apoſtles, the Lorde working with them, preached in all places.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> If ſuch be the efficacie of the worde
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:173499:84"/> of God, howe commeth it to paſſe that all men which heare the ſame, doe not beléeue it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ,</hi> I anſwere that that commeth to paſſe by meanes hereof, becauſe it is not giuen to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie one to knowe the miſteries of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God. And for this cauſe it is not giuen to euerie man to know the miſteries of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, becauſe all men are not of God.<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 11.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> That which is openly preached in the hearinge of all, that is receiued of all men. But the word of God is hearde as well of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull,<note place="margin">Iohn. 8. 47.</note> as of the faithfull which are preſent. Therefore is it receyued as well of the one as of the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> I anſwere, there is a double fallacie in this argument. In the <hi>maior</hi> propoſition there is a<note place="margin">Or a crauing o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> that to be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted which is chiefly in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie. Or a fallacie grounded vpon the diuerſe ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications of one word.</note> fallacie called * <hi>petitio principii.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly in this worde <hi>Hearde</hi> there is * <hi>fallaci aeqniuocationis,</hi> and alſo in theſe words <hi>the worde of God,</hi> The vnbeléeuers doe heare with their eares the externall worde of God, but they doe not receyue into a pure hearte the ſeede of the internall worde. Therefore that ſame externall worde is a teſtimonie againſt them. But the faithfull doe heare the holy ſpirite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly beating into them, and ſealing vp in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, thoſe thinges which the miniſters doe outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teach, and teſtifie: foraſmuch as this thing is giuen vnto them alone, and not vnto the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

                  <p>If you looke firſt into the ſignification of the worde. Some men are ſaide to heare the word of God, properly, namely, theſe which heare<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 22.</note> the ſame and vnderſtande it, and bring foorth fruit. Otherſome doe heare the worde impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 19. 20. 21.</note> either with a wauering minde, or at leaſt but for a certaine ſeaſon, or finally beeing too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too much addicted vnto worldly cares and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly if you reſpecte the inſtrumentes. The worde of God is hearde with the eares, if you meane the externall worde: inwardly with a faithfull heart, if the internall word.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. Doeth the internall worde differ from the the externall in forme?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> No, for the holy ghoſt and the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters conſenting together doe preach all one worde, they differ onely in the ordinarie admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the ſame.

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:173499:87"/> and the internall. The miniſters they ſpeake the worde, the holy ghoſt doeth beate into the heart the meaning thereof.</p>

                  <p n="1">1 Firſt, what the feare of God doth ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie. The feare of God ſignifying not only the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, but alſo the reuerence due vnto God, is commonly called of the <hi>Grecians <gap reason="foreign">

Hereof haue we a moſt notable example in this hiſtory, in hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling whereof (if God permit) we will ſpeake in order of two thinges: namely, of the perſons, and of the ſpéech.</p>
               <p>The perſons are of two ſortes, the perſon of him which made this oration, and the perſons to whom it was made.</p>

               <p n="1">1 The credit and countenance of an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour dependeth vpon the power and maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty of his prince. <hi>Haggeus</hi> did his meſſage not in the name of a mortall king, but in the name of that bleſſed and onelie king, the king of kings, and Lord of Lords, who onlie hath immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.

               <p>Certaine there were in times paſt which did ſuppoſe that <hi>Haggeus, Zacharias,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> were not men, but angels: and that by the appointment, and commaundement of God they tooke to them-ſelues bodies. They rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned thus.</p>
               <p>Theſe thrée perſons before named, are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the ſcriptures * Angels. Therefore they were not men ſubiect to the like paſſions, as wée be. For-aſmuch as diuers kindes cannot be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed of the ſame thinges.</p>
               <p>I anſwere, there is a fallacie of equiuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this word angell, which is not the name of the nature, but of thoffice, being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon vnto the miniſtring ſpirits, and the holy men of God, which are ſent ambaſſadours in the name of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And although wée doe graunt that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels doe by Gods appointment take vnto them mens bodies, (that the godly may the leſſe bee feared here-with:) yet doe we thinke that they doe both fooliſhlie and alſo daungerouſlie goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to prooue that, by the example of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation of the Worde, as theſe wordes doe ſéeme to import. <hi>Neither is this anie maruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous thing to bee belieued of the angels, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that euen the verie ſonne of God tooke</hi>

               <p>Moreouer, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> is falſe which (as <hi>Hierome</hi> ſaith) y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame heretiks taught, namely, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> all reaſonable creatures haue one nature, for this cauſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe men which haue pleaſed God, ſhall bée equall with the angels.

                  <hi>Cyrillus</hi> ſubſcribing hereunto, in his eleuenth booke vpon <hi>Iohn. Cap. 19.</hi> ſaith, whileſt Chriſt

For mans minde is wont to giue credit not to hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> things, but to things that are euident. Although therefore the Lord whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is abſent in body, can doe all things what-ſoeuer hee will, (for Chriſt Ieſus is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame yeſterday, and too day, &amp; remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the ſame for euer:) yet his apoſtles being depriued of his preſence, coulde not but be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, eſpecially ſéeing that the waues of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world did with great rage beate againſt them, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoured by all meanes poſſible to throw them downe when-as they preached the truth.</p>
               <p>Qu. Is that ſelfe ſame * humanitie euerie<note place="margin">Or man-hoode.</note> where, after a ſpirituall maner?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> Yea truely. For hee is preſent with the faithfull in all countries and places, by the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his merites, his power, his maieſty, and<note place="margin">Ephe. 4. 10.</note> giftes: yea, hée fulfilleth all things here-withall.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> By the imparting of properties, that is, the manner of affirmation, whereby the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the natures are attributed vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole perſon in the concrete. Therefore Chriſt was at that time in heauen, and in all places, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his diuine nature: but according to his humanity he was in that place where <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> found him, and ſpake vnto him.</p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:173499:95"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cyrillus</hi> interpreteth theſe word. <hi>When as</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>the ſonne, being the Worde of <hi>GOD,</hi> came downe from heauen, hee ſaith that the ſonne of man came downe, refuſing to bee diuided into two natures after his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation: neither ſuffred hee any man to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that the temple which was taken of the Virgin was one ſonne, and the word of <hi>GOD</hi> an other, although theſe things which are in both of them naturally, may be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueniently diſtinguiſhed. For as the Word is of God, ſo is the man of the woman. Therefore is Chriſt one of both, being indiuiſible in his ſonne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode, &amp; diuine maieſtie.</hi> For how can the thinges which are proper onelie to the worde of God, be otherwiſe applied vnto the ſonne of the Virgin? And on the contrarie, how can y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> things which belong only to the fleſh, be attributed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the word of God? For he ſaith now, that the ſonne of man is come downe from heauen, and it is written that in the time of the paſſion, the ſonne of God him-ſelfe did feare, as if hee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe did ſuffer, which thinges are onely proper vnto his humanitie.</p>
               <p>Qu. Doth the ſonne of man, and the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie ſignifie all one thing?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An. Noe. The man Chriſt, the ſonne of man, of God, of the higheſt:</hi> doe ſignifie his perſon in the concrete. <hi>The godhead, the word</hi> the perſon taking: <hi>The fleſh, the humanity,</hi> doe ſignifie the nature taken.</p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:173499:96"/>
               <p>Qu. Is not Chriſt diuided, when-as it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, that his fleſhe is euerie where with the worde?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> He is not diuided. For to be euery where together is not the ſpecificall difference of the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the word, and the humanity: (for then ſhould the father, the ſonne, and the holy Ghoſt be all one perſon, and not thrée diſtinct perſons, ſeeing they are together euery where, which are one in eſſence) but <hi>to make one perſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Furthermore, foraſmuch as the Godheade is infinite and incomprehenſible, as it is with-out the humane nature, ſo is it in the ſame, and ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned perſonally to the ſame.</p>
               <p>Qu. To Chriſt is giuen all power, therefore the vniuerſall preſence or vbiquitie.</p>

It is proper to God alone to appropriate vs to himſelfe, and to dwell in vs, according to theſe ſayings. <hi>Know yee not that ye are the temple of God? If any man deſtroy the Temple of God, him ſhall God deſtroy: for the temple of God is holy, which you are. 1.

                  <p>Theſe thinges are ſpoken of the Church, and of the liuely members thereof, wherein<note place="margin">Inſt.</note> without doubt, the holie ſpirite doth dwell: but the queſtion was alſo mentioned con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the temples made with handes.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:173499:103"/> Let vs therefore heare what Auguſtine ſaith, who denyeth that the Temples are erected vnto the Martyrs. <hi>To God,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>doe we builde Temples, although they be named after the names of the Martyrs, to put men in minde of the Martyrs.</hi>

                  <p>And whereas <hi>Hierome</hi> in a certaine place ſayth, that the temples of the martyrs are to bée had in great reuerence, it ought not be preiudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall to this matter. For certaine it is that the honour which is due vnto God alone, muſt not be giuen to Martyrs, neither is their bloude to be mingled with Chriſt his bloud, which is the price of our redemption. The memoriall of the martyrs, and the great admiration which their giftes wherein they excelled did and doeth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, ought to ſerue to the glory of God alone, and to our amendment, becauſe hee powred out vpon them the gifts of his grace in ſuch aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunce.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ier. 23. 16. Thus ſaith the Lord of hoſtes, Heare not the wordes of the prophets which prophecie vnto you, they teach you vanitie, they ſpeake the viſion of their owne hearts, not out of the mouth of the Lorde. 17. In ſaying, they ſay to thoſe which diſpiſe me, the Lord hath ſaide peace ſhalbe vpon you: and to euerie one that walketh in the hardnes of his heart. There ſhall no euill come vppon
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:173499:106"/> you. 18. For who hath ſtoode in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of the Lord, and hath ſeene and hearde his woorde? Who hath marked his woorde and hearde it?</hi>

                  <p n="2">2 They to whom the publiſhing of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of God is committed, muſt ſpeake in the name of the Lord, and not in their owne name. <hi>Amos. 27. 14. Amos anſwered Amaſia: I am no prophet, nor the ſonne of a prophet, but an heard-man, and a gatherer of wilde figs, 15. But the Lorde tooke mee as I followed my cattell, and the Lorde ſaide vnto mee: goe prophecie vnto my people Iſraell:</hi>

                  <p>16. <hi>Nowe therefore heare the woorde of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hee teſtifieth both things: firſt, that hee was called vnto the office of a prophet: and ſecondly, that in the name of God, hée ſpake his woorde.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 And this preaching and publiſhing of the will of God muſt ſerue for all thoſe which are of the people God.

The Apoſtle ſaith that the fathers did eat the ſame ſpirituall meat, and drinke the ſame ſpirituall drinke, which we eate and which wee drinke. Which thing all the godlie and theſe which haue vnderſtanding, doe ſée to bée vnderſtoode of the ſubſtaunce and fruite of the Sacramentes, and not of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall ſignes.</p>
                  <p>Theſe and other ſuch like ſayings doe teach vs that there is but one Teſtament, and one co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenaunt of grace in ſubſtance and trueth.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Notwithſtanding the olde Teſtament &amp; the Newe doe ſo differ in the diſpenſation: that the newe Teſtament doeth farre exceede the olde. <hi>Math. 13. 17. Verily I ſay vnto you, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie Prophetes and iuſt men haue deſired to ſee the thinges which you ſee, and haue not ſeene them, and to heare the thinges which you heare, and haue not hearde them.</hi> Yet let vs knowe that theſe thinges are ſpoken re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectiuely, and not ſimplie. For hee doeth not denie that the Fathers knewe the ſame kinde of doctrine, but he preferreth the eſtate and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Chriſt his Church before the diſcipliue of the lawe, as beeing better. For after that Chriſt the light of the worlde beganne to teach, there did ſo great light of the knowledge of God ſhine in the heartes of the faithfull, that hee
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:173499:116"/> that was leaſt in that newe eſtate of the church, was greater in the kingdom of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then Iohn the baptiſt, if you conſider the plentifulnes of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. In the eight to the Hebrues, verſ. 7. the apoſtle reaſoneth thus: If that former teſtament (he meaneth the olde teſtament) had bene ſuch, that there had beene nothing wanting therein, then had there béene no place ſought for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond. But there hath béene a place ſought for the newe couenant. verſ. 8. 9.</p>
                  <p>And that may be vnderſtood of the worde, and the ſacramentes. For ſéeing the ſame doctrine, the ſame faith, and the ſame Chriſt doth raigne in the Church of both teſtamentes, the diuerſity of diſpenſation conſiſteth in the letter admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, (and whether you reſpect the preaching of the word, or the adminiſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) and not in the ſpirite and trueth.</p>
                  <p>But ſome there bée which doe attribute vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Fathers the ſhadowes, and vnto vs the trueth. And to the end they may prooue this, they alleadge the wordes of the Apoſtle. <hi>Heb, 10. 1. The lawe hauing a ſhadowe of good thinges to come, and not the very expreſſe forme of thinges. &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwere. Firſt, they falſely take that as ſpoken ſimply, which is ſpoken reſpectiuely, and by way of compariſon, touching the moſte ſolemne yéerely ſacrifice, which was nowe abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, when Chriſte was vpon the Altar of the Croſſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if they attribute no more vnto the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:173499:117"/> Fathers but the ſhadowes, and doe ſpoyle them of the truth: then ſurely they thinke y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> there was but ſmall prouiſion made for their ſaluation, and reſtoring. For what? ſhall wee thinke that any man can bee ſaued without the trueth?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, why doeth Paul attribute to vs Circumciſion made without handes <hi>Col. 2. 11.</hi> and to the Fathers Baptiſme, and the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all meate, and drinke, 2. <hi>Cor. 1. 2:</hi> if the thing ſignified by the Sacrament, be not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the faithfull of both Teſtamentes?

                  <p>All theſe thinges may we briefely ſet downe thus.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 The voyce of the Lorde ſhaketh the worlde and the inhabitantes thereof. The voice of the Lorde doeth ſometimes ſignifie thunder and the noiſe of tempeſtes *, ſometime it doeth<note place="margin">Pſal. 29.</note> ſignifie the worde of the Lord.</p>

                  <head>A reaſon.</head>
                  <p>For there is nothing wherein the true Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, or faithfull, take greater pleaſure, then in the enlarging of Chriſtes kingdome, and in the gathering together of the ſaints, and in the veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the earthly Temple made with hands, as being a certayne type and figure, whereof it is ſaid: <hi>Being built vpon the foundation of the prophets, and apoſtles, Ieſus Chriſt him-ſelfe being the head corner-ſtone.

                  </p>
                  <p>And certaine it is, that the Gentiles were to bée called ſhortly after vnto the eſtate of the ſaintes in the light.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon is drawen from Gods purpoſe. <hi>I will mooue all nations.</hi> The meaninge thereof is this, All nations ſhalbe mooued, when God ſhalbe reuealed in the fleſhe, iuſtified in the ſpirit, ſéene of Angels, preached to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and belieued on in the worlde, and receiued vp into glorie. <hi>1.

                  </p>
                  <p>In this <hi>minor</hi> propoſition wee will note theſe pointes of doctrine.</p>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:173499:122"/>
                  <p>1 There is nothing which doth more mooue, and ſtirre vp the mindes of men, then the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the celeſtiall doctrine.</p>
                  <p>All men, ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> are naturally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to knowe. But ſéeing that (as the ſame<note place="margin">Metah. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith) one knowledge is better then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: either becauſe it is more certaine, or<note place="margin">Top. 8.</note> becauſe it is of a better thinge: it is with-out all doubt that the doctrine which is not of men, but from heauen, is to be preferred before all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kindes of doctrines, both ſéeing that it is moſt certaine, and is alſo occupied about a moſt certaine matter. And the more accompt wee make of this doctrine, ſo much the more are wee mooued and ſtirred vp there-with. And <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> ſaith well, that although all knowledges bee<note place="margin">Meta. 5.</note> noble, yet is the diuine knowledge more noble, becauſe the ſubiect thereof is more noble. But I will ceaſe to ſpeake of theſe thinges.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 For-aſmuch as the preaching of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, which came from heauen as it doth appéere, came about the time of reformation; it ſhooke all theſe, both by abrogatinge the diſcipline of the lawe, and the ſacrifices: and alſo by calling the Gentiles vnto the light of faith and grace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> in theſe woordes ſheweth why it was néedefull that the adminiſtration of the lawe, ſhould bee taken away: <hi>Chriſt is our peace, which hath made both one, &amp; the ſtop of the wall of ſeperation hath he taken away: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing abrogated through his fleſh the hatred,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:173499:122"/> that is lawe of commaundementes, which did conſiſt in ordinaunces: that of theſe two hee might make one new man in him-ſelfe, making peace. Eph. 2. 14. 15.</hi> The Apoſtle his meaninge is this, that the ceremoniall worſhip whereby the Iewes and the Gentiles were ſepe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rated, being taken away by Chriſt, they ſhould make one myſticall bodye of Chriſtes Church, whoſe head is Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 The meaning of the vniuerſall woord, is the ſame which our Apoſtle taught. <hi>Rom.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. 29. 30. Is hee the God only of the Iewes and not alſo of the Gentiles? yes euen of the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles alſo. For there is one God that ſhall iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie the circumciſion of faith, and the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſion through faith.</hi> And againe, the woordes of <hi>Peter</hi> bee theſe. <hi>Act. 10. 34. 35. In truth I finde that God is no accepter of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but that in euery nation, euery man is acceptable to him, which feareth him, &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth righteouſnes.</hi> Nowe doe I conclude: the Iewes muſt néedes goe forward ſtoutly and couragiouſly in the worke of the Lord, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged with the expectation of theſe thinges, and euen for this cauſe muſt they builde the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, becauſe it ſhould be a figure of the coupling together of the faithfull, and of that moſt holy building of the Church of the faithfull, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there is a moſt excellent picture extant. <hi>Iſai. 54, 11. 12. The poore woman being toſſed with tempeſt hath receiued no comfort: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde I will lay thy ſtones in Carbuncles, &amp;
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:173499:123"/> I will lay thy foundation in the Saphyres. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I will make thy windowes of pearle, and thy gates of the ſtones of Carbuncle, and all thy borders of pleaſaunt ſtones.</hi>

                  <p>13. <hi>And all thy children ſhalbe taught of the Lord, and hee ſhall multiplie the peace of thy children.</hi>
                  </p>

               <p>THe proofe of the <hi>minor</hi> propoſition doth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe in this aſſumption: <hi>And the deſire of all the Gentiles ſhall come,</hi> that is, the Meſſias which hath bene longe and much looked for of all the Gentiles.</p>
               <p>It is certaine that the Gentiles ſhall then bee more vehemently ſhaken, and that all thoſe which are predeſtinate vnto eternall life, ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be called out of darknes into light, and vnto the fellowſhip of the true Church, when-as the Meſſias ſhall come. But hee ſhall come ere it be longe: for the time which was before appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the incarnation of the woorde is, at hand. Therefore it is with-out all doubt, that the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and gathering together of the Gentiles vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the true Iſraelites is alſo at hand.</p>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:173499:123"/>
               <p>1 Of theſe things will wee ſpeake in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Firſt, what wée ought to thinke according to the ſcriptures, of the comming of the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, and of his preſence in the Church, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence from vs.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly, why the Meſſias is called the deſire.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Thirdly, why hee is called the deſire of all the Gentiles, ſéeing the Gentiles were not ſo well perſuaded concerning the incarnation of the Woorde, as were the Iewes.</p>
               <p>1 Certaine distinctions concerning the comming of the Meſsias, and of his preſence in the Church, and abſence from the ſame.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Chriſt is one way preſent with all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and an other way with his Church. Hée is preſent with all creatures ſubſtantially, eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiallie, preſentlie, mightelie, (if you reſpect the Woorde) who, ſéeing hee is by nature God, he is infinite and from euerlaſting. Therefore, hée is incomprehenſible, both in reſpect of time, and alſo of place.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Hée is, hée hath bene, and will bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with his Church alwayes, and in al places, according to theſe ſayings. <hi>Hebr. 13. 8. Ieſus Chriſt is yeſter-day, and too-day, and is the ſame for euer.</hi> That is, euen from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:173499:124"/> of the Worlde hath our Lorde Ieſus<note place="margin">Mat. 28. 28.</note> bene the Mediator betwene God &amp; men *. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I am with you alwayes. 1. Cor. 10. 4. For they all drunke of the ſpirituall rocke which followed them: and the rocke was Chriſt. ver. 9. Neither let vs tempt Chriſte as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of them tempted and periſhed by ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents.</hi> Therefore was hee preſent with the Fathers, &amp; did feede them. <hi>Iohn. 14. 18. I wil not leaue you fatherleſſe.</hi> And let vs remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber for our comforts ſake, that wee can no more bee left fatherleſſe nowe, then coulde the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles in times paſt, and alſo that Chriſt did pray euen for vs alſo. <hi>Iohn. 17. 20. 21.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 For with-out Chriſte there can bee no Church. As the body is vnperfit, if it want the heade: ſo there can bee no Church of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect at all, with-out Chriſt the heade. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is it that <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith that wee are elected in Chriſte, and that wee are made one bodie with him, and in-grafted into him.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Chriſte is preſent with the Church, as in the perſon of a Lorde, ſo in the perſon of a Mediatour.</p>
               <p>The perſon of the Mediatoure comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vnder it the office of a Kinge, a Prophet, and a Prieſt. Therefore Chriſte Ieſus doth defend and gouerne vs: by the miniſtery of the ſpirite he inſtructeth vs: and making interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 4.</note> for vs, by the efficacie of his merites, hee obtayneth mercie for vs, at the handes of his<note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> Father.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:173499:124"/>5 It was ſaid in times paſt that he ſhould come, in reſpect of the incarnation of the Word. For when the fulnes of time was come, hée was ſent of his father, hee was made of woman, hee<note place="margin">Gala. 4. 4.</note> was made ſubiect to the law. Therefore doth hée affirme that he was ſent of his father. <hi>Ioh. 6. 38. I came downe from heauen, that I might doe not mine own will, but the will of him which ſent me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6 Hee aſcended into heauen, his bodie and ſoule being taken vp into heauen. So is it in the godlie confeſſion of the Church of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſill,</hi> in the article concerninge Ieſus Chriſt God and man.</p>
               <p>Therefore let vs not yeeld vnto the opinion of thoſe men which make the fleſh of Chriſt inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and doo verie inconſtantlie affirme that he is preſent with vs bodilie, yet inuiſibly.

               </p>

Therefore ſhall alſo eternitie, the greateſt ſimplicitie, and other adiuncts of the God-heade be actuallie in the fleſhe of Chriſt. Which euery man of ſounde iudgment, dooth ſée to be falſe.</p>
                  <p>I will adde in ſtéede of a concluſion <hi>Paul</hi> his expoſition vpon the oracle, of the comming of the deſire of all the Gentiles. <hi>Ieſus Chriſte being in the forme of <hi>GOD</hi> thought it no robberie to bee equall with <hi>GOD.</hi> But he made him-ſelfe of no reputation, takinge to him the ſhape of a ſeruaunt, and was made like vnto men, and was founde in his apparell as a man, he humbled him-ſelfe, being made obedient vnto death, euen vnto the death of the Croſſe. Phil. 2. 6. 7. 8.</hi> Hée which was longe looked for, came when-as the Woord was made fleſhe. <hi>Iohn. 1.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The forme of GOD doth ſignifie in this place the diuine nature, as <hi>Baſil</hi> taught godlily, whoſe woordes are theſe: <hi>That which is in the forme <hi>GOD,</hi> is in the ſubſtance of <hi>GOD,</hi> for the forme of <hi>GOD</hi> is not one thinge, and the ſubſtance an other, being not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounde: hee therefore which is equall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordinge to the forme, hee is equall accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſubſtance. Baſil</hi> reaſoneth thus,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:173499:127"/> by reducing his argument vnto that which is vnpoſſible. If in the perſon of the Woorde, the forme of God were one thinge, and the eſſence of God another thinge, then were God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and not ſimple: but the conſequent is abſurde, therefore is the antecedent abſurde alſo.</p>
                  <p>Nowe ſeeing that the forme of a ſeruaunt is ſet againſt the forme of God: what man is hee that is well in his wittes, that doth doubt that it doth ſignifie the humane nature? More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer <hi>Paul</hi> calleth it the ſimilitude of men, and that hee was founde in apparell as a man. Neither did that glory which was annexed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the humane nature, take from it the truth and properties of nature: as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> taught very well.

               <argument>
                  <p>Why is the Meſsias called the deſire?</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THis did Chriſt expounde <hi>Luke. 10. 23. 24. Bleſſed are the eyes which ſee thoſe things which you ſee. For I ſay vnto you, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie prophets, and kinges haue deſired to ſee

                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> Haue not therefore the holy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and kinges ſéene and hearde Chriſte?

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I deny the conſequent, and my reaſon is this: becauſe in this obiection there is <hi>ignora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio elenchi</hi> ignorance of an argument. For theſe are not ſpoken both concerninge one thinge. The ſaying of Chriſte in Iohn intreateth of the faith in Chriſt, which is common to all the elect, whereby <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his true ſonnes are ſaid to ſée Chriſt. But in theſe woordes which are in <hi>Luke</hi> hee ſpeaketh of the meaſure, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées of light, and of faith, in ſome reſpect, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the difference which is betwéene the two Teſtamentes, which is fet from the meaſure of the reuelation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu. But for what cauſe is hee ſaid to bee deſired?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwere.</hi> The cauſe is ſet downe in theſe words of the Prophet, and the Apoſtle. <hi>Iſa. 61. 1. 2. 3. The ſpirit of the Lord vpon mee, becauſe the Lorde hath annoynted mee: to preache glad tydinges vnto the meeke hath hee ſent me, to binde vp the broken in heart, to preach libertie to the priſoners, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:173499:128"/> of the pryſon vnto thoſe which are bounde. To preach the acceptable yeere of the Lorde, and the day of vengeance of our God, to comforte all that mourne. To ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point vnto them that mourne in Sion, and to giue to them for aſhes, oyle of gladneſſe, for mourning, the garment of gladnes, for the ſpirite of heauines &amp;c. Ioh. 11. 25. I am the reſurrection and the life &amp;c. 1. Cor. 1. 30. Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is made vnto vs of God, wiſedome, and righteouſnes, and ſanctification, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore I reaſon thus from theſe benefites which wee haue by Ieſus Chriſt. Hée is right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaide to be deſired, which is ſight to the blind, life to the deade, reſurrection to them which lye in the duſt of the earth, the right way to them which wander and are out of the way, wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to the fooliſh, righteouſnes to the giltie, ſanctification to the vncleane and prophane, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption to the pryſoners. But Ieſus Chriſt our Prophet, our king and mediator: is and doeth all theſe thinges for vs, and many moe. Therefore hee is rightlie ſayde to bee deſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p>3 <hi>But whie is hee called the deſire of all the Gentiles?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> Some man will perhaps reaſon on the contrarie, thus: No man is deſirous of that which hee knoweth not. The promiſe of the comming of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was vnknowen to the Gentiles: but the Iewes knewe it full well.
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:173499:129"/> Therefore the <hi>Meſsias</hi> ought to bee called the deſire of the Iewes, and not of the Gentiles.</p>
               <p>I aunſwere <hi>confitendo</hi> by confeſſing. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the promiſe concerning the ſending of the <hi>Meſsias</hi> was not ſo much beaten into the heades of the Gentiles, as of the Iewes: yet is Chriſt rightly tearmed the deſire of the Gentils, becauſe hee was to bee ſent, euen for their ſakes alſo, that he might deliuer them out of the power of darkenes. And why maſt thou not confeſſe y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> hee is rightly called thy deſire, which was as they ſay the heade and the helme.</p>
               <p>But I reaſon thus. Seeing that God is the redeemer onely in <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> Chriſt is rightly called their deſire, whoſe God (that is redemer) is the Lord. But the Lorde is the God not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Iewes, but alſo of the Gentiles. <hi>Rom. 3. Surely of the Gentiles alſo.</hi> Therefore I conclude that the Lorde Ieſus is the deſire aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well of the Gentiles as of the Iewes.</p>
               <p>I prooue the <hi>maior.</hi> For they whoſe God is the Lorde, are not onely perſwaded that Chriſt hath created them, but alſo that hee is their redeemer. As by faith they perceyue that the worlde was made by the worde of God: ſo beeing iuſtified by faith, they confeſſe that they beléeue the remiſſion of ſinnes.</p>
               <p>In like ſort I prooue the <hi>minor.</hi> GOD doeth iuſtifie none but thoſe whoſe mercifull God hee is. But hee doeth <hi>iuſtifie the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of faith, and the vncircumciſion by fayth. Rom. 3. 30.</hi> Therefore hee is the God
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:173499:129"/> aſwell of the circumciſed as of the vncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the fleſh.</p>
               <p>Let vs throughly ponder theſe and ſuch like ſayinges, that beeing mindfull that we are ſprong from the wild Olyue trée, wée may with one minde and one mouth giue thankes to our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who hath deliuered vs from the power of darkeneſſe, and hath tranſlated vs into the kingdome of light. To him be glory for euermore. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>The Lorde maketh anſwere, that all the ſiluer and golde is his, which is in the whole worlde: yet are not the temples adorned w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>A briefe inſtitution briefely ſet downe, concerning the golden veſſels, and ſiluer veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of Temples.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 The vſe of veſſels of golde, and veſſels of ſiluer was neceſſarie in times paſt in the <hi>Leuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall</hi> ſacrifice. That may be gathered, firſt out of the ſpeciall commaundementes of God concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the gathering of theſe metals, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of diuers veſſels of the ſame to diuers vſes: ſecondly, out of the holy rites of the ſacrifices, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes, ſacraments, &amp;c. And that ceremoniall worſhip had many peculiar thinges, which wee cannot now imitate without ſuch emulation as is not tollerable: ſéeing that the manner of our adminiſtration is farre vnlike to that.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The vſe of theſe veſſels is nowe indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent: ſéeing there is no eſpecial commandement extant concerning the matter of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> veſſels, which we vſe in the adminiſtration of the ſacraments, and alſo ſéeing that is certaine that Chriſt and his Apoſtles did vſe common veſſels.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="202" facs="tcp:173499:133"/>3 Therefore let vs remember that the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels which wee now vſe, are not to bee eſtéemed according to the priſe &amp; profit of the matter, nor yet according to the ſingular wormanſhip of the forme, but according to the vſe and end thereof. Woulde to God theſe men would thinke vppon this, which doe thinke that the Lordes ſupper cannot be celebrated without ſuch chalices as the maſſemongers did vſe: and for this cauſe they turne the cups which haue beene long time vſed amongeſt vs, into chalices.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 We muſt néedes confeſſe that not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Apoſtles time, firſt the veſſels of woode, and afterwarde the veſſels of glaſſe being taken away, they began to vſe veſſels of gold &amp; veſſels of ſiluer, if at any time the ſacramentes were to be miniſtred. <hi>Zephorinus</hi> the Pope hauing ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away wooden veſſels, did put in place there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of veſſels of glaſſe.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Vrbanus</hi> who entred the Popedome in the yeere of Chriſt 227. and in the third yéere of <hi>Alexander Seuerus,</hi> hauing aboliſhed the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of <hi>Zepherinus:</hi> did commaunde that they ſhoulde vſe veſſels of golde and ſiluer, and if they had none ſuch, that then they ſhoulde vſe veſſels of Tynne.</p>
                  <p>Hée prouided verie wiſely (I warrant you) both for the poore and alſo for the rich. I thinke hee woulde haue giuen them leaue to haue vſed woden veſſels, &amp; of glaſſe, if they had not had veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of mettall. But I thinke it will not bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe, here to recite theſe thinges which are ſet
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:173499:133"/> downe in the Popes lawe, <hi>Diſtinct. 1.</hi> The<note place="margin">The Popes lawe.</note> veſſels vſed in the celebration of the holy myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are chalices, and pattins, concerning which <hi>Bonifacius</hi> the martyr and biſhoppe being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked whether it were lawfull to celebrate the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes in wooden veſſels or no? he aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that the Prieſtes in times paſt did vſe not golden, but wooden chalices. <hi>Zepherinus</hi> the ſixtenth biſhoppe of Rome did decree, that the maſſes ſhould be celebrated in Pattins of glaſſe. After that <hi>Vrbanus</hi> the Pope made all the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring veſſels of ſyluer. For in this, as in the other kinds of worſhip, the dignitie of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches hath increaſed more and more by encreaſe of time. For in our dayes (which are ſeruantes of the good man of the houſe) that the dignitie of our mother the Church may not bée any whit deminiſhed, but rather augmented and much inlarged: wee doe ordayne that hereafter no prieſt preſume any way to celebrate the holy myſterie of the bodie and bloude of our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt in veſſels of wood: leaſt God be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uooked to wrath with that wherewith he ſhould bee pacifyed. <hi>Alſo that the Lordes chalice with the pattin bee made, if not of golde, yet of ſyluer. And if any man be ſo poore that he cannot ſo haue it, yet let him haue a chalice of tinne. And let not the chalice be made of braſſe, or of latin, which by reaſon of the vertue of wine procureth canker, and alſo cauſeth vomitte. But let no man preſume to ſing Maſſe in a chalice of wood, or of glaſſe.</hi>

                  <p n="4">4 Fourthly, that they ſuppoſe that God is pleaſed with veſſels of golde and ſyluer, and is diſpleaſed with theſe that were baſer. Surelie then there was but bad prouiſion made for the Apoſtolike Church, whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Conſtantinus</hi> the great did wonderfully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich the Churches with veſſels of golde and of ſiluer: but <hi>Iulianus</hi> the <hi>Apoſtata</hi> did ſhortlie after take them away, as the eccleſiaſticall hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie doeth teſtifie.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Notwithſtanding the holy biſhops did more regard the lyuing veſſels then the metals. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of haue we a notable example in the hiſtorie of <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> who in his ſeconde booke of offices. Chap. 18. writeth thus: <hi>As we ſometimes were hated, which broke the miſticall veſſels that we might redeme the priſoners: which thing might diſpleaſe the Arrians, and not ſo much the fact, as that they might haue ſomewhat
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:173499:134"/> which they might reprehende in vs.</hi> And a little after. <hi>Which thing although wee did not without ſome reaſon, yet were wee ſo ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted amongſt the people, that we did confeſſe, and proue, that it was much better to keepe ſoules for the Lorde, then golde. For hee which ſent his Apoſtles without golde, hath alſo gathered Churches together without golde. The Church hath golde, not to keepe, but to beſtowe, and to ſuccour in time of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie. What neede haue wee to keepe that which helpeth nothing? Doe not we knowe that the Aſſyrians did robbe the Temple of the Lorde of great ſtore of golde and ſyluer? Doth not the Prieſt better gather it together, that it may ſerue the poore, (if other helpes doe fayle) then that the ſacralegious enemie ſhoulde carrie it away? Shall not the Lorde ſay: why haſt thou ſuffered ſo manie poore people to ſtarue? And yet thou haddeſt gold to buy them foode withall. Why were ſo manie priſoners ledde into captiuitie, and not redeemed? Why were they ſlayne? It had beene better for thee to haue ſaued the veſſells of the liuing, then of metals.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this purpoſe ſerueth the 17. Law in the booke <hi>Lib. 1. Tit. 5. l. Sancimus. If need ſhall require in redeeming of priſoners, then wee doe graunt licence both to ſell the foreſaide thinges, and alſo to lay them to gage: foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it is no abſurde thing to preferre the</hi>
                     <pb n="209" facs="tcp:173499:135"/> ſoules of men, before all matters, veſſels, and garmentes.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 Theſe wordes of <hi>Ambroſe</hi> doe teach vs, what anſwere we ought to make to thoſe men, which crie out that the ſacraments are diſpoiled of their dignitie, if golden veſſels, &amp; ſiluer veſſels be not vſed in the adminiſtration thereof. <hi>I was affraid, wouldſt thou ſay, leaſt the Temple of God want his furniture?

                  <p n="7">7 Therefore if wee doe vſe in our Churches veſſels of golde and ſiluer in the adminiſtration of the Lordes ſupper: yet let vs vſe them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all boaſting, and opinion of the neceſſitie and price of the matter thereof.

                  <p>They which broche, and bring abroade the oracles of GOD, are the faithfull miniſters of God his Teſtament, who as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith doo ſowe ſpirituall thinges. It is required at the hands of theſe, that they bée faithfull. 1. <hi>Cor. 4. 2. It

                  <p>
                     <hi>An.</hi> I anſwere. Things which are ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, are not contrary. God alone doth giue ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall gifts, if you reſpect the principall cauſe: but if you reſpect the inſtrumentall cauſes ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing out-wardly, then méeteth you that ſayinge of the Apoſtle: <hi>Therefore who is Paul, or who is Apollos, but miniſters by whom you haue belieued, and as God hath giuen to euerie man? 1.

                  </p>
                  <p>And here muſt wée admoniſh the younger ſorte, that they doe diligently diſtinguiſhe theſe ſayings, wherein the whole miniſtery is ſpoken of in generall, from theſe where-in it is ſpoken of in part, that is, where-in mention is made ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the inward, or outwarde miniſtery. For if they reſpect the former ſorte, they ſhall often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times finde that thinge attributed by <hi>Synecdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che</hi> to the miniſters of the woorde, as to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour cauſes: which is proper to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> principall efficient cauſe. As theſe two ſayings doe teſtifie, where-with wée will at this time bee conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. <hi>Who-ſoeuers ſinnes yee remit they are remitted vnto them: and who-ſoeuers ſinnes yee retaine, they are retained.

                  </p>
                  <p>Paul ſpeaketh of the partes of the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by an oppoſition, where hee ſaith: <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, neither hee that planteth is any thinge, neither hee that watereth: but God who gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the encreaſe. 1.

Although wee are not ignorant of this, that God who worketh moſt freely, doth worke ſome-times by meanes, ſome-times with-out meanes, and that hee is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble if he will, to giue ſpirituall things with-out the externall ſignes: yet muſt we doe all things decently, and in order, according to the rule which hee hath ſet downe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obiect.</hi> Paul ſaith: <hi>Chriſt hath not ſent mee to baptize: but to preache the goſpell.</hi> Therefore the Woorde and the Sacramentes may not bee ſeperated.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Good God howe vnlearned and monſtrous are thoſe ſpéeches which wée ſée ſome men vſe (by whom the Lorde doth tempt and prooue vs nowe): namelie, that the bodie of Chriſt is receiued with the mouth, and that as well of the Infidles, as of the Belieuers? And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, that the verie body of Chriſt is put into the mouth of the receiuer, by the hand of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the woorde.</p>

                  <p>Queſt. What thinkeſt thou of that nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſaying of Macarius the Egyptian. The bread and the wine are types of his fleſhe, and bloude, and they which receiue the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible bread, doe eate the fleſhe of the Lorde ſpiritually?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> I doo very well like that ſaying, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were it an hard matter to gather together many ſuch like ſayings, where-in the like thing is affirmed. Not-withſtandinge, this ought to ſatiſfie vs, that the ſame is extant in the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the confeſſion of <hi>Baſill.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Queſt. But ſome there bee which doe thinke that it is an abſurde thinge for any man to ſay, that the bodie of Chriſte is eaten ſpirituallie, and not corporallie? For they reaſon thus. The bodie of Chriſt is eaten, therefore it is eaten corporallie, and not ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituallie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> To the ende I may anſweare briefly, I ſay, that as ſurelie as wée receiue the bread and wyne of the Lord, ſo ſurely are wée made partakers of the bodie and bloude of the Lorde in that holie Supper. For the Lords Supper conſiſteth vppon theſe earthlie thinges, and the heauenly thinges, both which wée receiue.</p>
                  <p>2 And as touching the receiuing of heauenly things, I ſay more-ouer, that wée receiue them
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:173499:144"/> onely after a ſpiritual manner. Nowe I adde this reaſon: becauſe theſe thinges are not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent as in place, therefore not viſiblie. And for this cauſe are they not preſent as in place and viſiblie, becauſe they are not preſent corporallie, and therefore are they not perceyued by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde ſenſes. Verie excellent truely is that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the counſell of <hi>Nice</hi> concerning the holie ſupper of the Lorde. <hi>And here agayne tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Lordes table: wee doe not baſelie ſet our mindes vppon the breade and the cup which are vpon the table, but lifting vp our mindes, we perceyue by faith the lambe of God, which is ſet vppon that holy table, which lambe taketh away the ſinnes of the worlde, which was profanely ſlayne by the Prieſtes, and wee truely receyuing his hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble bodie and bloude, doe beleeue that they are ſignes of our reſurrection. And for this cauſe wee doe not receyue much, but a little, that wee may knowe that wee eate not to fill our bellies, but vnto ſanctification.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I might adde alſo an other reaſon drawen from the definition of the naturall and bodilie eating: which teacheth vs that the liuely fleſhe of Chriſt is not eaten bodilie &amp; with the mouth. The ſame is extant. <hi>Mark. 7. 18. 19.</hi> But I will ſpeake thereof elſe where if the Lord will, and giue me leaue.</p>
                  <p>If any man ſay that the bodie of Chriſt is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſacramentally, not ſpiritually, we wil pray him to learne to ſpeake properly with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:173499:145"/> and not to trouble the yonger ſort with ſuch darke ſentences. Foraſmuch as the Lordes breade is the Sacrament of the bodie of Chriſt, and therefore is the breade called the bodie of Chriſt by <hi>Metonymia:</hi> hee which eateth this breade, eateth the bodie of Chriſt ſacramental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie. To the end the yonger ſort may vnderſtand theſe thinges: I ſay that the bodie of Chriſt is called his bodie ſometimes properly, ſometimes <hi>metonymically.</hi> As the bodie of Chriſt (as it is called his bodie properly) is giuen to be eaten of vs truly and ſpiritually, ſo is it receyued of vs truely and ſpirituallie. But the body of Chriſt, as it is called the bodie metonymically, (that is the Lords bread, if you reſpect the ſame as it is breade is eaten naturally: and if you reſpecte it as it is the Sacrament of the bodie of Chriſt, hee which eateth this bread eateth the bodie of Chriſt ſacramentally. But let it ſuffice to haue ſpoken thus much by the way. For euen three wordes are ſufficient in a good cauſe. God graunt that all thinges may ſerue to his glorie and our inſtruction.</p>

               <p>IF, as <hi>Galene</hi> doeth thinke, the Phiſitions ought to behaue themſelues in the cutting vp of the brayne, as in a temple where the holy ceremonies are done decently &amp; orderly: much more ought they which ſtudie the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures with great reuerence rightlie to cut in péeces, and diuide the worde of trueth, in the ſchoole of the holy Ghoſt. Therefore I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſéech the eternall GOD to ſanctifie vs by his trueth, and to giue vs grace ſo to enter into the ſecret corners of this oracle, that we may thence gather and bring ſuch thinges as may ſerue to the ſanctifying of Gods holy name, and our own ſaluation.</p>
               <p>Moreouer if euery thing which is ſet in order be comelie as ſayth <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> then is the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this oracle moſt comelie, foraſmuch as it is ſet in very good order. Which we intend now to declare vſing a diuiſiue inſtrument.</p>
               <p>The partes of the Oracle are two in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, a parable, and an exhortation. </p>

               <p>The partes of the argument, wherein the Prophet proueth that the Iewes, and their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did diſpleaſe God, becauſe they were vncleane, are thus diſpoſed.</p>
               <p n="1">1 It contayneth an <hi>exordium,</hi> concerning the perſous which were their owne iudges. verſe, 12.</p>

               <p n="4">4 The applying of the former parabolicall problemes vnto the Prophets purpoſe. Wherin he teacheth that both the people of the Iewes, and alſo all their worſhippe which they did to God, ſo long as the Temple was vnbuilt, was vncleane, &amp; for this cauſe was not acceptable in the ſight of God. ver. 15. And we ſee that in all theſe there is a preuenting of an obiection which is this: As if our ſacrifices, Sacramentes, holie dayes, and all our ceremonies which God hath appointed, coulde diſpleaſe the Lord, the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple beeing yet not built, ſo that for their ſakes, wee muſt needes builde the Temple, leaſt God doe not allowe of them. The Prophete aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth that all theſe thinges were prophane, and not acceptable in the ſight of God, becauſe that neglecting the temple (which God woulde haue builded) they woulde rather purchaſe and
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:173499:146"/> demerite his fauour by their ceremonies.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>The exhortation.</head>
                  <p>The other part of the oracle conſiſting vpon an exhortation vnto a more narrowe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the life, dependeth vpon the former part, and may be thus deuided.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Firſt it containeth a rehearſall of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer life, and of thoſe euils whereunto it was ſubiect, and of the principall cauſes thereof.

That they were puniſhed it appeareth in the 16. verſ. The cauſe why they were puniſhed is ſet downe verſe 18.

                  <p n="2">2 Secondly it comprehendeth a promiſe of a bleſſing which God will ſend vppon the Iewes, after they haue taken in hande the building of the Temple. In this place we will note two circumſtances, the one concerning the time, the other concerning the perſons, for the Prophete declareth who will bleſſe, and whome hee will bleſſe. verſe. 19. 20.</p>
                  <p>All theſe thinges tende to this end, that we may knowe, that all thoſe are accurſed, which buſte themſelues ſo in holy, ciuill, and houſholde affaires: that they haue no regarde of the glorie

                     <hi>Hierome</hi> interpreteth this place on this wiſe: <hi>There is an other queſtion propounded to the prieſts: becauſe they anſwered well to the
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:173499:157"/> former, and there is as it were a certaine kinde of probleme or darcke queſtion fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, where-in an vn-ſkilfull perſon might eaſely erre. For admit ſome man be ignorant of the law, and like-as he anſwered touching the ſanctified fleſhe, that the fleſhe, or pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, or wine, or oyle, or other meates, are not ſanctified: ſo will hee in like ſorte an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere in this, and ſay: that hee which is pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted in ſoule, cannot pollute theſe thinges which the holie fleſhe coulde not ſanctifie. Therefore he aſketh this queſtion, and ſaith, If he which is polluted in ſoule: that is, if he which is made-vncleane by touchinge of a deade man, ſhal touch any of all theſe things, as bread, or wyne, or pottage, or oyle, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meates, ſhall theſe thinges bee made vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane by his touchinge of them? And the prieſtes, the chiefe where-of was Iehoſua the ſonne of Iehoſadack, by whom they knewe the lawe, anſweared and ſaide: All theſe thinges are vncleane, which hee which is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane doth touche.</hi> Thus farre goeth <hi>Hierome.</hi>

                  <p>The probleme is, Are theſe things made vncleane, which hee which is vncleane by the lawe, doth touche? The anſwere. They are. For as to thoſe that are cleane, all thinges are cleane: ſo, to the vncleane and Infidels, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge<note place="margin">Tit. 1. 15.</note> is cleane, but their minde and conſcience is polluted.

                  <p>Further-more, here let the ſtudious youth note this diſtinction of vncleanes.

If any man had bene preſent with a man which was a dying: if any man had beene troubled with an iſſue of Seede: if any man had touched a menſtruous woman, or a deade carcas, or any other vncleane thing: hee was vncleane by the lawe. And there was, and is an-other kinde of vncleannes of the fleſhe, and of the Spirite, which floweth from originall ſinne, and is ioyned with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe.</p>

               <div type="part">
                  <head>1 The Propoſition.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Iewes are vncleane.</hi> Theſe woords ſeemed no leſſe ſtraunge to the Iewes in times paſt, which worſhipped God in the letter, &amp; not in the ſpirit: then theſe would bee in theſe daies: <hi>Many of the Chriſtians are vncleane, howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they frequent Sermons, and vſe the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And let vs note theſe aphoriſmes concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge vncleannes, which wee muſt ſet downe according to the queſtions of a Methode, <hi>An ſit, quid ſit, quare ſit, quòd ſit: <hi>Whether it be, what it is, wherefore it is, and that it is.</hi>
                     </hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1 All men are vncleane. <hi>Prou. 20. 6. What man can ſay: I haue cleanſed my heart, I am cleanſed from my ſinne?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 There is vncleanes of the fleſhe, &amp; there is vncleanes of the ſpirit. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 1. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it appeereth that the whole man is defiled, &amp; not the one part of him onely.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 But this vncleanes procéedeth from the fleſhe, and not from the ſpirit. Therefore Paul reciteth vncleannes amongſt the workes of the fleſhe. <hi>Gal. 5. 19.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:173499:159"/>
                  <p>4 Not-withſtanding, this vncleannes is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed one way to the children of God, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other way to the vnbelieuers. For the children of God are vncleane in ſome reſpect: firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are infected with originall ſinne: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, for-aſmuch as they are not fully regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated: laſtly, becauſe beinge ouer-taken with ſome offence, they muſt pray with <hi>Dauid: O God create in mee a new heart. Pſal. 51.</hi> But the vnbelieuers becauſe they be deſtitute of faith (where-by the heart is purified) they are, and are called ſimply vncleane.</p>
                  <p>Now let vs alſo briefly touche the cauſes of cleannes. The efficient cauſe there-of is Chriſt Ieſus. <hi>Heb. 2. 11. For both he that doth ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie, and they which are ſanctified are all of one.</hi> The helpers are the regenerate. <hi>Iſa. 1. waſh you, be you cleane.</hi> The ſacrament or ſigne, is baptiſme. <hi>Eph. 5. 26. That he might ſanctifie it, purging it by the waſhing of water throughe the word.</hi> The principall ſubiect, is the heart. <hi>Pſ. 51. Create in mee o God a new heart.</hi> The forme, the wiping away of the filthines, &amp; the act of continuall ſanctification. The next end. <hi>That it may bee a glorious Church, with-out ſpot or wrinkle. *</hi> The laſt end, <hi>to ſee God. * Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 7. Mat. 5. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>are the pure in heart, becauſe they ſhal ſee God.</hi> Let it be ſufficient to haue ſpoken thus much touching the propoſition.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>2 The Amplification.</head>
                  <p>This amplification is contayned in theſe wordes, <hi>In my ſight, ſaith the Lord.</hi> As if he
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:173499:160"/> ſhoulde ſay, Although you ſeeme to your ſelues to bee cleane in the ſight of the Lord our God, yet doth hee plainely teſtifie, that you are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane. The iudgement of God concerning the cleane and cleanes, is not like to the iudgement of men. Men doo often-times count them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane, who in the ſight of God are cleane, and on the contrary. But God who beholdeth the heart knoweth beſt what ought to bee thought of euery man.</p>
                  <p>Further-more, it often-times falleth out that a man deceiueth him ſelfe, accordinge to that ſaying of Solomon: <hi>There is a generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that are pure in their owne conceite, and yet are they not waſhed from their filthines. Pro. 30. 12.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obiect.</hi> The euents are anſwerable to the counſels and iudgementes of God. But the cleane and vncleane haue all one euent, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that ſaying of Solomon: <hi>All things fall out a-like to all. The iuſt and vniuſt, the good and cleane, and vncleane, hee which ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, and he which ſacrificeth not, haue one euent: as is the good, ſo is the ſinner, &amp;c. Eccle. 9. 2.</hi> Therefore God doth not iudge the cleane and vncleane.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>An,</hi> I anſwere vnto the <hi>minor</hi> propoſition, where-in there is a fallacie from that which is ſpoken in ſome reſpect, vnto that which in ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſimplie. Certaine euents both proſperous, and infortunate, are common aſwel to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as to the vnfaithfull: but not all. Often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:173499:160"/> both of them are in aduerſitie: ſometimes both of them doo enioy proſperity for a ſeaſon. But like-as euen proſperitie turneth to the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of the infidels: ſo aduerſitie doth profit the faithfull. Theſe latter euents are not common to the cleane and vnfaithfull.</p>

                  <p>THe induction where-by our prophet confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the propoſition is this. <hi>All the Iewiſh nation is vncleane. All the workes of the hands of this ſame people are vncleane. The offrings which the Iewes haue offred to God are vncleane. And all thinges what-ſoeuer they doe are vncleane.</hi> Therefore this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is true: <hi>The Iewes are vnclean.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this induction we will note theſe fiue points.</p>
                  <p>1 The order of thinges. Hee begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth with the Iewiſh nation as with the Vine which bringeth foorth wilde grapes, &amp; not good grapes. That done he procéedeth vnto the works of their handes, that is, vnto their houſholde and ciuill affaires, which ſerue properly to the maintenance of this naturall life. Laſtly, hee aſcendeth vnto the higheſt degree, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth the adminiſtration of the prieſtes,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:173499:161"/> and hee teſtifieth that the Iewes are vncleane in reſpect of all theſe thinges, and therefore are they ſubiect to the wrath of God.</p>
                  <p>The ſeconde thinge which we haue here to note, is, that vnder theſe woordes (<hi>Nation,</hi> and <hi>People</hi>) the prophet comprehendeth the men of honor, of meane eſtate, and of loweſt degrée. <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaias</hi> the prophet in his, 1. <hi>Cap. 5. 6.</hi> vſing an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legorie, accuſeth in theſe woordes all eſtates of men. <hi>Euerie head is weake, and euerie heart is heauy: from the ſoale of the foote vnto the head, there is nothing whole there-in, but wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, &amp; ſwelling, &amp; ſores full of corruption.</hi> You ſée how vprightly, and vncorruptly the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets behaued them-ſelues, if at any time they were to reprooue ſinnes which were committed by men of all eſtates. Their foote-ſteps muſt we follow, &amp; it is our duties to rebuke ſinners with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out flattery, or reſpect of perſons.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Thirdly, we note that the works of our hands are vncleane, vnles they bee ſanctified by praier, and the worde of God. Therefore <hi>Dauid</hi> in the 90. <hi>Pſalme</hi> praieth thus. <hi>Let the beutie of the Lord our God bee vpon vs, and direct the worke of our hands.</hi> Faith acknowledgeth and profeſſeth that al our labour is in vaine, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les the Lord doo bleſſe the ſame, according to that which is written in the 127. <hi>Pſalme, 1. ver. If the Lord build not the houſe, their labour is but in vaine which builde it: if the Lorde keepe not the City, the watch-man watcheth but in vaine.</hi>
                     <pb n="257" facs="tcp:173499:161"/> 2. <hi>It is in vaine for you to riſe earlie, and to lie downe late, eating the breade of ſorrowe: ſo will he giue his beloued ſleepe &amp;c.</hi>
